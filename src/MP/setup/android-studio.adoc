https://www.java.com/en/[Java]
//
code using the
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Android Studio]
//
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and test your apps using the
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html[Android Emulator].

This guide will help you install and configure this important and powerful
development tool.

[[intellij]]
== Android Studio

[.lead]
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Android Studio]
//
is _the_ integrated development environment (IDE) for Android development.
//
This semester all CS 125 lab programming assignments and MPs will be done using
Android Studio.

Follow the instructions below that are appropriate for your machine.
//
But keep in mind that installing new software can be challenging, so don't be
discouraged if you get stuck.
//
We're here to help!
//
Come to office hours or

the Android Studio category].

[[version]]
=== Version

For Fall 2019 we are using Android Studio version 3.5, which is the latest
available as of September 2019.
//
Please install this version of Android Studio and continue using it throughout
the semester.
//
Minor upgrades are probably safe to install.
//
If a major upgrade is released, the course staff will let you if it is safe to
use.

[[install]]
=== Installation

Begin by downloading the version of Android Studio appropriate for your machine
using
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[this link].
//
Next, follow
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html[these excellent installation
instructions].
//
**Please follow them carefully**.

[[plugins]]
== Android Studio Plugins

Once you have <<install, installed Android Studio>>, continue by installing two
Android Studio plugins:

. https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea[The `checkstyle` IntelliJ plugin]
//
. Our official link:/tech/intellijplugin/[CS 125 IntelliJ plugin]

[[checkstyle]]
=== `checkstyle` Plugin

We use
//
http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/[`checkstyle`]
//
to help you learn how to write beautiful and maintainable code by requiring you
to adhere to a coding standard.
//
**There are points on each MP for `checkstyle`, so you want to get the plugin
installed so that you can check your style in Android Studio.**

Installing this plugin is straightforward:

. Open the Android Studio plugins menu
//
. Click on "Browse repositories..."
//
. Search for "checkstyle" and install the "Checkstyle-IDEA" plugin that appears
//
. Restart Android Studio to complete the installation

You should install the latest version of the `checkstyle` plugin, currently
5.23.0.
//
`checkstyle` plugin updates that are released during the semester should be safe
to install.

[[cs125plugin]]
=== CS 125 IntelliJ Plugin

Our official link:/tech/intellijplugin[CS 125 IntelliJ plugin]
//
will both simplify your MP development process and help us ensure that you are
making satisfactory progress on each assignment.
//
You can read more about it
//
link:/tech/intellijplugin[here].

Installing our plugin is straightforward and similar to <<checkstyle,
installing the `checkstyle` plugin>>.

. Open the Android Studio plugins menu
//
. Click on "Browse repositories..."
//
. Search for "CS 125" and install the "CS 125 @ Illinois" plugin that appears
//
. Restart Android Studio to complete the installation

You should install the latest version of our plugin, currently 0.2.1, and any
updates we release during the semester.

[[emulator]]
== Android Emulator

An important part of Android development is to be able to test your work.
//
If you have an Android device, you can configure Android Studio to install your
test app onto it.
//
However, if you don't have an Android device, or want to test on devices other
than ones that you own, you'll need to utilize the
//
https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html[Android Emulator].

The easiest way to get a virtual device set up is to
//
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/[start a project, build it,
and then try to run it].
//
That will launch a dialog allowing you to configure a virtual device.
//
Going through the
//
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/[Android "Hello, World!"
tutorial]
//
is also a great way to get started familiarizing yourself with app development.

[[devices]]
== Running on Real Devices

If you have an Android phone you can also install and run your apps on your own
device, which will be faster and more fun that using the emulator.
//
Follow
//
https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app[this
tutorial]
//
for instructions on how to configure your device properly to run your apps
during development.
