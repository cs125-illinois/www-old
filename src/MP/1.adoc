[.lead]
//
In the first Machine Project checkpoint, link:/MP/0[MP0], you started making a
cool Android app
//
footnote:[Well, at least _we_ think it's cool...].
//
This checkpoint and all subsequent ones build on that codebase, adding new
features and improving the structure of the code.

In this second checkpoint (MP1), you will use your new _object-oriented
programming_ skills to package up some game logic into a _class_ that will help
you implement a new mode of the game.
//
You will take advantage of Android Studio's UI designer to create an interface
that allows the user to select the game mode.

In _area mode_, the objectives that can be captured are rectangular cells on an
evenly spaced grid rather than specific targets.
//
Entering a cell captures it&mdash;if possible.
//
If at least one capture has already been made, subsequent cells can only be
captured if they share a side with the most recently captured cell.

Again, **deadlines for each checkpoint vary by your deadline group**.
MP1 is due at:

* **8 PM on Sunday 10/6/2019 for the Blue Group**: all labs starting at 2 PM or
earlier
//
* **8 PM on Monday 10/7/2019 for the Orange Group**: all labs starting at 3 PM
or later

Since MP1 is another multi-week checkpoint, 10% of your grade on it is for
submitting code that earns at least _40 points_ by **Sunday 9/29/2019 (Blue)**
or **Monday 9/30/2019 (Orange)**.
//
Late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/syllabus#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[learning]]
//
== Learning Objectives

This is the first checkpoint that makes use of object-oriented programming.
//
In addition to the imperative skills you practiced on MP0, you will:

. implement a class to bundle state and behavior,
//
. obtain and use instances of existing classes,
//
. work with data in multidimensional arrays, and
//
. design a user interface

[[structure]]
//
== Assignment Structure

You'll be working on the same repository for the entirety of the Machine
Project.
//
MP0 focused only on the Java code files, but Android projects have another major
part: _resources_.
//
These are found in the `res` folder, which is in the `main` folder that also
holds `java`.
//
The resources you'll work with most are _layouts_, which are stored in the
`layout` subfolder of `res`.
//
They represent the screens and controls the user sees when using your app.
//
The Android section later in this document will tell you more about how to work
on the user interface.

[[mp1]]
//
=== Obtaining MP1

[.lead]
//
You already have your GitHub repository ready to go; all that's missing is the
test suite for Checkpoint 1.

To do this we are going to provide you with a _patch_: a single file that
contains multiple changes to your project.
//
The patch for MP1 adds two files: the test suite itself and an Android Studio
run configuration that will allow you to run the test suites easily.

To apply the patch and get started on MP1, follow the following instructions:

. **First, commit your work!**
//
This makes sure that you can easily undo any problems that the patch may cause.
//
It should apply cleanly, but you never know.
//
. **Next, download the
//
link:/MP/patches/MP1.patch[patch file]**.
//
Remember where you put it since you'll need it in the next step.
//
. **Open your MP in Android Studio and then select "VCS | Apply Patch".**
//
Select the patch you saved in the previous step.
//
Android Studio will allow you to review the changes that the patch will make to
your project.
//
You'll see two new files: `Checkpoint1Test.java` (the test suite) and
`Test_Checkpoint_1.xml` (the Android Studio run configuration).
//
. **When you're ready select OK to apply the patch.**
//
If the patch is successfully applied, you're ready to get started on MP1!
//
You should have a new "Test Checkpoint 1" test menu item available&mdash;if not,
try repeating the magic "Sync Project with Gradle Files" from the File menu.
//
. **If the patch does not apply cleanly, please get help right away!**
//
Post on the forum, come down to office hours, or get help in lab next week.
//
MP1 is a challenge and we want you to get started right away.

You also need to configure the autograder so that it knows that you're working
on MP1.
//
Open the `grade.yaml` file in the root of the project, change the `checkpoint`
setting from `0` to `1`, and do _File | Sync Project with Gradle Files_.
//
Running the Grade task should then produce a grade report for Checkpoint 1
rather than Checkpoint 0.

=== Late MP0 Submissions

If you didn't finish the `TargetVisitChecker` functions in MP0, you can still do
MP1.
//
Changing the `useProvided` setting in `grade.yaml` from `false` to `true` (after
updating `checkpoint` to `1`) and doing a Gradle sync will make the app and
grader use our correct `TargetVisitChecker` implementation.
//
That is, calling `TargetVisitChecker` functions from `GameActivity` will produce
the result from our solution, not your code.
//
If you're happy with your `TargetVisitChecker` implementation, leave
`useProvided` set to `false` to continue using your MP0 code.

5% of the MP1 grade requires a working target mode game, so even if you use our
provided `TargetVisitChecker` functions, you will still need to implement the
`GameActivity` logic of MP0 yourself.
//
If you have not done this, please do so now.
//
Come to office hours if you need help.

If you want to go back later and work on a late MP0 submission for half credit,
change the `checkpoint` setting in `grade.yaml` back to `0`.
//
That tells our grader to do an MP0 grading run.
//
It's OK if you've started working on MP1 or even a later checkpoint when you
regrade MP0.
//
The test suites are forward-compatible.

== Android

MP1 continues introducing you to Android development.
//
We'll introduce a couple new ideas and tools below.
//
There's a bit more work to do than on MP0, but the MP1 tasks should be more
straightforward, especially since you've started finding your way around the
codebase.

=== UI Designer

Most Android resources are link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML[XML] files.
//
While it is possible footnote:[and necessary for advanced applications] to edit
these directly, Android Studio provides a graphical interface that makes it much
easier to design your UI layouts.
//
When you open a layout XML file, Android Studio shows a preview of the layout in
the main view.
//
(If you instead see a bunch of text, switch to the Design tab in the lower
left.)

Every piece of user interface offered by Android has a type of _view_, also
called a _control_ or _UI element_.
//
For example, a `Button` view represents a button the user can push to do
something.
//
A `TextView` is a plain label that displays some text.
//
An `EditText` is a box that the user can type text into.
//
To the upper right of the UI preview, you'll find the Palette pane, which shows
many kinds of views available to you.

Android organizes views into containers nested inside each other.
//
For example, a row of buttons might be represented by a `LinearLayout`
containing several ``Button``s.
//
That could then be nested inside other containers to build a more complex
screen.
//
To the lower left of the preview, you'll see a Component Tree pane.
//
This shows the hierarchy of all controls in the layout.
//
To add a view, drag your desired kind of view from the Palette pane to where you
want it to be in the Component Tree.
//
To delete a view and any views inside it, right-click it in the Component Tree
and choose Delete.

When you select a view in the preview or Component Tree, the Attributes pane on
the right shows many _attributes_ (properties) that you can set for that view.
//
For controls that have text, the `text` attribute sets the text initially
displayed by the view.
//
The `id` attribute at the top sets the view's ID that can be used in code to
manipulate the view.

[.alert.alert-warning]
//
--
//
Some attributes appear twice in the Attributes pane, once with a wrench icon and
once without.
//
The value of the setting with the wrench is only visible in the preview, not
during testing or in the app.
//
You almost always want to use the setting _without_ the wrench.
//
--

=== Manipulating UI from Java

[.lead]
//
Usually at least part of a user interface is dynamic, changing at runtime when the user
does something or when data is fetched.
//
To make this happen, your Java code needs to be able to manipulate the UI elements.

Android exposes views to Java as objects with functions that allow you to get
information about the view or modify its attributes.
//
If a view has an ID set in the Attributes pane of the UI designer, you can get
an object representing it from the `findViewById` function.
//
For example, this code gets a `TextView` object corresponding to the `TextView`
with ID `greeting`:

[source,java]
----
TextView label = findViewById(R.id.greeting);
----

The variable type (e.g. `TextView`) must match the type of view from the UI designer.
//
The variable name (e.g. `label`) can be anything of your choosing.
//
The field name after `R.id.` is the view ID from the UI designer.

[.alert.alert-warning]
//
--
//
Since the view classes are defined in Android rather than your project, they
have to be _imported_ before you can use them from your code.
//
Android Studio can help with this: if you tab-complete the class name as you're
typing it, the needed import statement will be automatically added to the top of
the file.
//
--

Once you have a view object, you can use dot notation to call its functions and
do something with it.
//
For example, all views have a `setVisibility` method to change whether the view
can be seen.
//
If the greeting label was invisible or gone, this code would make it visible
again:

[source,java]
----
label.setVisibility(View.VISIBLE);
// or pass View.INVISIBLE to make it invisible
// or View.GONE to make it gone (invisible and taking up no space)
----

Views that display text have a `setText` method to change the text:

[source,java]
----
label.setText("Hello!");
----

Member functions can also be used to set handlers&mdash;code that will be run
when something happens to the view, like a button being clicked.
//
The syntax for handlers is a little messy, but Android Studio's tab completion
can help you with it, as can the examples in our starter code or in lab.
//
For example, this attaches a click handler to a `Button` variable named
`goodbye`:

[source,java]
----
goodbye.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(final View v) {
        // Change the label's text
        label.setText("Goodbye.");
    }
});
----

Or more concisely:

[source,java]
----
goodbye.setOnClickListener(v -> {
    // Change the label's text
    label.setText("Goodbye.");
});
----

=== Multiple Activities

Most apps have multiple different screens that are shown at different times.
//
To switch to a different activity, code has to launch the new activity using an `Intent`.
//
An intent specifies what is to be done and provides any extra information needed to do
that&mdash;kind of like calling a function.

To create an intent to launch an activity, you need to specify the current context
footnote:[usually `this` but possibly `CurrentActivity.this` if you're inside a non-concise handler]
and the new activity:

[source,java]
----
Intent intent = new Intent(this, OtherActivity.class);
// Don't worry about what the .class part means
----

Once you have an intent, you can pass it to the `startActivity` function to act on it:

[source,java]
----
startActivity(intent);
----

By default, when a new activity is launched, the user can return to the old one
by using the back button on the device.
//
To make the old activity completely finish and no longer be available, you can
call `finish()` after the `startActivity` call.

Additional data that needs to be passed to the new activity can be placed in _extras_.
//
Intent extras are identified by a string name and can have various kinds of values.
//
Each intent can have many extras.
//
To add an extra, use a `putExtra` instance method of the intent:

[source,java]
----
intent.putExtra("name", "Jane Smith");
intent.putExtra("gpa", 4.0);
----

To access this data from the new activity, use the `getIntent` function to get
the `Intent` that was used to launch the activity.
//
To extract extras from the intent, call the `get<Type>Extra` functions, like
`getStringExtra` or `getDoubleExtra`.
//
The functions to get extras of primitive types require you to specify a default
value that will be returned in case that extra wasn't present.
//
For example:

[source,java]
----
Intent intent = getIntent();
String name = intent.getStringExtra("name");
double gpa = intent.getDoubleExtra("gpa", 0.0); // 0.0 is the default
----

If you'd like more information, feel free to refer to Android's
//
link:https://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters[official `Intent` documentation].

== Your Goal

When you're done with MP1, your Campus Snake 125 app will support target mode and the new area mode.
//
In area mode, the map will show a grid of cells and highlight captured cells with green rectangles.
//
There will be a user interface to select the game mode and set game configuration
(proximity threshold for target mode, area and cell size for area mode).

MP1 is a step up from MP0, and may seem overwhelming at first.
//
This is normal!
//
As we always recommend: **start early**, take it one step at a time, get help
when you need it, and you'll be able to build amazing things.

=== `AreaDivider` Class

You may notice after acquiring the Checkpoint 1 test suite that the project can
no longer compile.
//
This is because the test code refers to an `AreaDivider` class that you need to
create.
//
So the first order of business is to define that class and the needed functions
on it.
//
To add a new class file in the Project view, right-click the package folder
(`edu.illinois.cs.cs125.fall2019.mp`) that contains all the existing files
you've been working on and choose _New | Java Class_.
//
Enter the class name, `AreaDivider` in this case, in the Name box and press OK.
If prompted to add the file to Git, press Add.

[.alert.alert-warning]
//
--
//
**You must create the new file in our package in `main` source set**,
//
the one containing all the other files you've been working on.
//
If you incorrectly create it in the `test` part of the project, the class may
appear to work locally but will not be usable from `GameActivity` or during
grading.
//
--

**To see what you need to add to this class**, refer to our
//
link:https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/1/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/AreaDivider.html[official Javadoc].
//
You may find our link:/MP/0/#_understanding_the_coordinate_system[coordinate system figure] helpful.

If you prefer to work on other parts of the checkpoint before _implementing_ these functions,
you can&mdash;you just need the class and its members _declared_ so that the test suite can compile.

=== Create Game Button

When the app is done, the main screen represented by `MainActivity` will have several options.
//
We'll start on it in this checkpoint by adding a Create Game button that takes the user to
the game setup screen, `NewGameActivity`.

Open the `activity_main.xml` layout resource file.
//
Add a `Button` with ID `createGame` and text "Create Game".
//
Then add code to the `MainActivity` Java file to make pushing the button launch
`NewGameActivity`.
//
For an example of how to attach a function as a button click handler, see the
provided `NewGameActivity` code.
//
For an example of how to switch to a new activity, see the existing code in
`MainActivity`: you need to make it switch to `NewGameActivity` rather than
`GameActivity` in the button click handler function.
//
`MainActivity` should no longer immediately launch `GameActivity`.

=== Game Setup UI

The game configuration screen will allow the user to select their desired game mode
(area or target) and set other parameters like the cell size or proximity threshold.
//
This screen's layout is `activity_new_game.xml` and its Java class is `NewGameActivity`.

Our starter version of the layout contains a `RadioGroup` with id
`gameModeGroup`.
//
Add two ``RadioButton``s (from the Buttons section of the Palette) to inside
this group.
//
One should have ID `targetModeOption` and the other should have ID
`areaModeOption`.
//
The user will use these to pick the game mode.

Some settings only make sense for one game mode, so they shouldn't be shown all
the time.
//
For example, the user shouldn't see a setting for proximity threshold when
setting up an area mode game.
//
To allow showing and hiding the different game-mode-specific settings as a unit,
we'll organize the views into containers.
//
Add some kind of container footnote:[probably a `LinearLayout`] inside the
existing `LinearLayout` and give it the ID `areaSettings`.
//
Move the `areaSizeMap` control inside this new container.
//
Also add to this container a numeric `EditText` control with ID `cellSize`: this
will allow the user to set the cell size.
//
For target mode settings, add another container with ID `targetSettings` to the
provided `LinearLayout`.
//
Inside that new container, add another numeric text box with ID
`proximityThreshold`: the user will use this to set a custom proximity
threshold.
//
Also feel free to add any labels or extra instructions you like.

To make the radio buttons change the containers' visibility, we need to add code
to `NewGameActivity`.
//
In `onCreate`, attach a handler that will be run when the selected radio button
in the `RadioGroup` is changed:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose modeGroup is a RadioGroup variable (maybe an instance variable?)
modeGroup = findViewById(R.id.gameModeGroup);
modeGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener((unused, checkedId) -> {
    // checkedId is the R.id constant of the currently checked RadioButton
    // Your code here: make only the selected mode's settings group visible
});
----

=== Game Setup Intent

Once the user has configured the game as they like by selecting the mode,
entering a cell size or proximity threshold, and panning/zooming the area map if in area mode,
they will press the Create Game button to start the game.
//
We attached a handler to that button that calls the `createGameClicked` function in `NewGameActivity`.
//
You need to fill out that function to populate an `Intent` with the game setup
and start the game activity.

Specifically, you need to add several extras to the `Intent` we initialized for
you.
//
The string extra named `mode` specifies the game mode, either "target" or
"area".
//
If the game is target mode, there should be an integer extra named
`proximityThreshold` specifying the proximity threshold.
//
If the game is area mode, there should be an integer extra named `cellSize`
specifying the cell size and four double extras&mdash;``areaNorth``, `areaEast`,
`areaSouth`, ``areaWest``&mdash;specifying the boundaries of the selected area.

To get all of this information, you will need to call functions of the view
objects.
//
``RadioGroup``s have a
link:https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RadioGroup#getCheckedRadioButtonId()[`getCheckedRadioButtonId`]
function that returns the `R.id` constant of the selected option.
//
Interestingly, the `getText` method of text-containing views doesn't return just
a string, but the result's `toString` method will get just the text.
//
To get the integer represented by a string of text, use Java's
`Integer.parseInt` function:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose textBox is an EditText variable
String text = textBox.getText().toString();
int number = Integer.parseInt(text); // This will crash if text isn't a number
----

Finally, Google Maps controls like `areaMap` have a function to get the visible
region (for the area boundaries) as a
//
link:https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/LatLngBounds[`LatLngBounds`]
//
object:

[source,java]
----
LatLngBounds bounds = areaMap.getProjection().getVisibleRegion().latLngBounds;
----

If the user didn't finish setting up the game before pressing Create Game&mdash;that is,
no radio button is selected or a needed numeric text box is empty&mdash;no intent should be launched.

=== Area Mode Gameplay

Now that you have the user's game setup stored in intents and an `AreaDivider` class to help with
area division and grid drawing, you can add logic to `GameActivity` to make area mode games work.

First, `GameActivity` needs to know the game configuration.
//
Add logic to `onCreate` to get the intent and record the needed information in
instance variables of your design.
//
You will probably want to wrap our provided target mode variable setup in an if
statement, then use the other (area mode) branch to create an `AreaDivider`
instance to manage cell boundaries and a `boolean[][]` to store whether each
cell has been visited.

Update `setUpMap` to check the game mode and render the grid if the game is area mode.
//
This should be very easy because all the work is done by the `AreaDivider` object.
//
If the game is target mode, markers should still be placed at target positions like in MP0.

Similarly, add a branch to `updateLocation` with area mode gameplay logic:
detect cell capture and show the user's progress on the map.
//
Initially any cell in the area can be captured.
//
Subsequent captures are only possible of the cell the user is currently in is
uncaptured and shares one side with the most recently captured cell
//
footnote:[which you can keep track of with instance variables].
//
When a cell is captured, it should be filled with a green polygon
//
footnote:[If you use the same color constant as in MP0, the polygons will be
completely opaque.
//
That's perfectly fine, but if you want to make them _translucent_ green the test
suite can accept that.].
//
To add a polygon to a Google Maps control, pass a
link:https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/PolygonOptions[`PolygonOptions`]
instance to the map's `addPolygon` method.
//
As you read the `PolygonOptions` method summary, look for two methods that
you'll need: one to add vertices to the polygon and one to set the polygon's
fill color.

To make the custom proximity threshold take effect, tweak your MP0 target mode logic in
`updateLocation` to use your proximity threshold variable instead of a constant.

== Grading

MP1 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

* **20 points** for the area division calculation features of `AreaDivider`
//
* **10 points** for the `renderGrid` function of `AreaDivider`
//
* **5 points** for the Create Game button in `MainActivity`
//
* **10 points** for setting up the user interface in `NewGameActivity` and
  making the radio buttons work
//
* **10 points** for making the Create Game button in `NewGameActivity` start a correctly
  configured `Intent`
//
* **20 points** for making area mode work by updating `GameActivity`
//
* **5 points** for making target mode respect the user's proximity threshold setting
//
* **10 points** for having no `checkstyle` violations
//
* **10 points** for submitting code that earns at least _40 points_ by 8 PM on your early deadline day

=== Test Cases

Just like link:/MP/0/#_test_cases[on MP0], we have provided a test suite that exhaustively
tests your code.
//
You should not modify the test suite, but feel free to examine it to see
what it is doing with your code, especially when you're debugging test failures.
//
`Checkpoint1Test` is stored in the same folder as `Checkpoint0Test`, under the `test` part
of the `src` folder hierarchy.

To run Checkpoint 1 tests, change the run configurations dropdown to Test
Checkpoint 1 and press the green run button.
//
You can also run a specific test function using the button in the left margin
when looking at the test suite code.
//
After updating `grade.yaml`, the Grade run configuration that you used in MP0
will grade MP1 instead.

=== Submitting Your Work

Follow the instructions from the
//
link:/MP/setup/git#submitting[submitting portion]
//
of the
//
link:/MP/setup/git#workflow[CS 125 workflow]
//
instructions.

=== Style Points

[.lead]
//
Like in MP0, 10% of your MP1 score is from successful `checkstyle` validation.
//
One thing checked by `checkstyle` is the presence of Javadoc documentation on each function
and function parameter.

Android Studio can help with this: once you've written a function signature,
typing `/**` (the start of a Javadoc comment) right above the function and
pressing Enter will insert any necessary `@param` and `@return` tags for you to
fill out.
//
`checkstyle` also wants all function parameters to be declared `final` (like we
did in MP0), which means you cannot reassign them inside the function.

== Cliffhanger

After completing MP1 you may be thinking that it would be nice to bundle all the target mode
logic together in one place and all the area mode logic together in another
rather than having all those if statements throughout `GameActivity`.
//
Later in lecture you'll learn about a concept called _polymorphism_ that will allow us to do this.

Now that we can create customized games, we'll want some way to share or join
games with other people and see ongoing games' configuration.
//
We'll start on that in the next checkpoint by connecting the app to a server.

== Cheating

All submissions on all CS 125 assignments will be checked for plagiarism.
//
You may not submit work done by anyone else, nor may you share your assignment
code with others.
//
Please review the link:/info/syllabus/#cheating[cheating policies] from the
syllabus.
