[.lead]
//
You've learned a lot this semester.
//
Now it's time to try out your newly-acquired super powers.
//
MP5 is not about us giving you something to do&mdash;it's about you
accomplishing something _you want_ to do using computer science.

MP5 is different than previous MPs.
//
It is done in pairs with a partner.
//
And it's due on lab day during the last week of class: so **Tuesday 5/5/2020**
//
footnote:[Cinco de Mayo!].

Also the best projects as rated by the class will earn <<extra, 1% extra credit>>.

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

If the Machine Project had you execute a carefully-planned route from point A
to point B, the Final Project takes you on a journey off the map.
//
You'll learn how to plan and execute a small Android project of your own design.
//
You'll also learn how to work with a partner.
//
All the skills you learned in the MP checkpoints will continue to be useful.

In many ways, the Machine Project has been designed to prepare you for this
moment.
//
The Final Project brings everything together and starts you out on a career as
an independent software developer&mdash;working on your own projects and
learning things that interest you.

[[rules]]
== Rules

Our goal in MP5 is to give you as much flexibility as possible, so there are few
rules about what you can and can't do.
//
But those that we do have are important:

You _must_ do something new for MP5.
//
Do not submit something from another class, or something you've done previously.
//
You may want to work on something that you've started on previously, but given
that you'll be working with a partner that's not fair to them.
//
So you should pick something new to do for MP5.
//
It doesn't have to be a huge project&mdash;you only have a few weeks.
//
But it should be original work.

Here are the rest of the rules:

* You need to build an Android app.
//
* You need to design a simple UI. We'll provide help with that in lab.
//
* You need to finish a UI mockup by the week before the final due date and show it in lab.
//
* You need to use a new web API, software library, or Android feature.
//
* You need to commit your work to version control&mdash;to either a public or private repository.
//
* You need to work with someone in your lab section.
//
* **You cannot build a weather app or a calorie counter.** We've seen too many of those recently.
//
* *Other than that, what to do is up to you.*

Note that we did _not_ say that your Android app has to be written in Java.
//
The adventurous among you may want to try out
//
https://developer.android.com/kotlin[Kotlin],
//
which is now Google's preferred language for Android development.
//
And the even more adventurous among you may want to give cross-platform app
development a try using a framework like
//
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/[React Native].
//
The goal here is to learn something new, so these kinds of adventures are not
discouraged.
//
However, keep in mind that on a whole the course staff will be less helpful if
you choose to use a language or framework they are less familiar with.

You turn in the Final Project by recording a YouTube presentation which will be
shown in lab during the last week of class.
//
You and your partner should plan that together.
//
**You _do_ have to publish your work on GitHub (or GitLab, or something
similar)&mdash;privately if you want.**
//
So you should set up your project using Git and be able to show that you have
committed and pushed your code to GitHub as part of your turn-in presentation.

[[partnering]]
=== Partner Rules

The Final Project is done in *groups of two*.
//
Obviously you want to find someone to work with that you enjoy working with and
think that you can do an awesome project with&mdash;since we will be giving
extra credit for some of the best projects.
//
You will also want to make sure that at least one of you has a laptop that can
smoothly run Android Studio and the emulator, or an Android phone for demoing
your new application.
//
This semester you'll also need to consider finding a partner that you can
regularly meet with remotely, meaning that they are in a similar time zone or at
least there is enough overlap so that you can communicate when needed.

You should start looking for a partner today (4/14/2020) and select one over the
next few days.
//
Feel free to reach out to friends, or use the forum to find a partner.
//
There is a UI checkpoint two weeks from now, so you will start losing credit
quickly if you don't have a partner.

[.alert.alert-warning]
--
We expect you to work in pairs. Projects completed by larger groups will not be
graded.
--

[[ui]]
//
=== UI Checkpoint

The second-to-last lab, on Tuesday 4/28/2020, will be dedicated to you showing
your TA the progress you've made so far.
//
By then, you should have at least a mockup of your app's user interface.

The app's functionality doesn't need to work yet, but you should have set up
much of the UI in your layout resource(s).
//
Pressing buttons should trigger _something_, even if that's just writing to the
Logcat to show that you've attached handler stubs that will be implemented
later.

This means that your app must have an interface that the user can interact with.
//
Apps that only run in the background or exit immediately do not qualify.

[[help]]
//
== Help and Tips

While the Final Project is self-driven, please feel free to approach the course
staff for help.
//
Post on the {forum}, or come to office hours and discuss your project idea and
implementation with the course staff.

[[libraries]]
//
=== Using Libraries

To use features and classes provided by a software library, you need to add it
to your project.
//
Many Java libraries are published to repositories that Gradle&mdash;the most
common Android build system&mdash;can access.
//
You can have Gradle install a library into your project by adding the library's
_dependency coordinate_ to the `dependencies` section of your Gradle
buildscript, the `build.gradle` file inside the `app` folder of your project.
//
The library's web page will probably include the line you can add to your
buildscript.
//
It will usually look something like this:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation 'com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1'
----

The `implementation` directive means that the library is used by your app, as
opposed to used only by tests or only needed at compile time.
//
The string inside the quotes is the dependency coordinate.  Here,
`com.android.volley` is the _group_, `volley` is the _artifact_, and `1.1.1` is
the _version_.
//
Gradle accepts multiple ways of identifying a dependency, so you might see other
formats too.

Some libraries' web sites might also provide instructions for downloading the
library code and manually adding it as a module to your project.
//
This is usually _not_ what you want.
//
If possible, find a dependency coordinate and install the library using Gradle.

(If the library isn't published in a way that allows you to import it using
Gradle, then we might advise you to steer clear anyway.
//
This is a sign of an old or poorly-maintained library.)

To learn how to use a specific library, refer to its documentation or search the
Internet for examples.
//
While the course staff are happy to help you look for resources, they have not
used every possible library.

[[webrequests]]
=== Making Web Requests

If you are using a web API for your app, you will need some way to make web
requests.
//
While there are several HTTP libraries for Android, we recommend the
https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html[Volley] library.
//
It is very similar to the `WebApi` component we provided with the Machine
Project footnote:[In fact, the HTTP parts of `WebApi` are a wrapper around
Volley with a little extra work for integration with Firebase Authentication and
Gson.].
//
Android provides https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple.html[an
introduction to using it].

All Volley requests are processed by a `RequestQueue`.
//
You can make just one queue per activity footnote:[or per app, though be careful
with `static` in Android] and use it for multiple requests.
//
To make a request, first instantiate a request object like a `StringRequest`.
//
The request object specifies the HTTP method, URL, response handler, error
handler, and possibly POST data depending on the request class.
//
Start the request by passing it to a queue's `add` method. Some time in the
future, your response or error handler will be called.

``StringRequest``s give you raw string responses, but many web APIs return JSON.
//
You can use https://github.com/google/gson[Gson]'s `JsonParser` to turn the
string into a Gson object footnote:[Gson even has ways to parse JSON into
instances of your custom Java classes.].
//
You could alternatively use Volley's
https://javadoc.io/static/com.android.volley/volley/1.1.1/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonObjectRequest.html[`JsonObjectRequest`]
or
https://javadoc.io/static/com.android.volley/volley/1.1.1/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonArrayRequest.html[`JsonArrayRequest`]
to have the text parsed for you, albeit into a different kind of Java object
than you used for the Machine Project.

[[github]]
=== Publishing to GitHub

Android Studio can help you put your project on GitHub.
//
The _VCS | Import into Version Control | Share Project on GitHub_ menu command
will start a process to create a GitHub repository and upload the contents of
your project.

To give your partner write access to the repository, add them as a collaborator
by opening the repository on the GitHub web site, going to the Settings tab,
selecting the Collaborators section, and adding them.
//
Your partner can clone the repository onto their computer, make changes, and
push just like you can.
//
You will want to pull (_VCS | Git | Pull_) before starting a work session so
that you can get any changes made by your partner.

[[grading]]
== Grading

Final Project grading is quite generous.
//
We care that you tried something new, not that you succeeded fully your first time.
//
It is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *20 points* for building an original _and working_ Android app
//
. *20 points* for the first UI checkpoint, shown in lab on 4/28/2020
//
. *20 points* for using a new web API, software library, or Android feature
//
. *10 points* for ensuring that all team members have roles in the project
//
. *20 points* for recording your YouTube video
//
. *10 points* for properly publishing your work to a version control site like GitHub

Unlike the Machine Project, there is no autograding or online testing for the
Final Project.
//
Grades are entirely at the discretion of the course staff.

*Also note that the Final Project cannot be dropped.*
//
It's too important&mdash;this is your chance to do something cool, creative, and
to show us everything you've learned this semester.

[[extra]]
//
=== Final Project Extra Credit

MP5 also provides an opportunity to earn extra credit by creating a very
impressive final project.
//
We will provide a form allowing staff to vote on which projects they found the
most impressive.
//
Each lab staff member will vote on all the projects from their lab.
//
The top rated projects _across the entire class_ will receive a *1%* increase
_in your final CS 125 grade_.

Note that _we will take into account your level of ability when you started CS
125_ when determining how impressive your project is.
//
So this is open to students of all ability levels.
//
This extra credit is also independent from any previous extra credit that you
might have earned earlier this semester.

[[submitting]]
== Submitting Your Work

You and your partner must prepare a presentation of at most _4 minutes_ before
the last lab section during the final week of class.
//
Prerecord your presentation and upload it to YouTube.
//
Lab staff will evaluate your video and project by viewing your video on Tuesday
5/5/2020, meaning that your videos must be uploaded by then if you want to
receive credit for the final project.

Your presentation should cover what you did, why you did it, who did what, and
any other interesting details: interesting technical problems you encountered,
how you collaborated, or ideas for future work.
//
You should also confirm that this was an original project and that it was
published under one or both of the project partners' accounts.
//
Don't use more than 4 minutes, but if you can demo your project and discuss it
sufficiently in less time, that's great!

We will post a form in a few weeks that you can use to submit details about your
final project.

[[cheating]]
=== Academic Integrity

Any attempt to turn in non-original work will be treated as an academic integrity violation.
//
Having someone else do your project for you or copying an existing codebase are forbidden.

However, in the real world it is very common to get _some_ help with projects
from other people or online sources.
//
You are free to show some code from your final project on the public {forum} or
copy-paste snippets of code from programming web sites.
//
If you use substantial snippets from outside sources, it can be good practice to
include the URL in a comment above the code that you borrowed.
//
This serves both to acknowledge the source and to remind you where it came from
in case you or your partner is trying to debug or understand it.
//
If in doubt, ask the course staff.
