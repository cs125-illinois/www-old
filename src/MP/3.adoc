[.lead]
//
In link:/MP/2/[MP2], you connected the app to our game server to get and respond
to invitations.
//
In Checkpoint 3, you'll make it possible to create multiplayer games of the two
game modes and _refactor_ some of your old code to improve it.

When you first started working on the MP, we hadn't covered object-oriented
programming yet, so the target mode functionality had to be implemented using
only arrays and imperative programming.
//
As you discovered, that was not ideal.
//
Programmers often learn or realize better approaches to problems already solved
and revisit old code to improve it.
//
This process is called _refactoring_.
//
In this checkpoint we'll refactor some of the code you wrote in MP0 and organize
some relevant logic into a class that can more easily be used in the next
checkpoint.

**Checkpoint 3 is a one week MP, so you only have one deadline**, which varies
by your deadline group. MP3 is due at:

* **11:59 PM on Sunday, 03/29/2020 for the Blue Group**: all labs starting at 3 PM or earlier
//
* **11:59 PM on Monday, 03/30/2020 for the Orange Group**: all labs starting at 4 PM or later

Late submissions are subject to the
//
link:/info/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[.alert.alert-warning]
//
--
//
**However, note that we will adjust the deadline as needed depending on the
success of our efforts to provide virtual support.**
//
--

== Learning Objectives

On MP3 you will:

* Work with and improve older code
//
* Build JSON objects to deliver additional information to the web API

We will continue to exercise your class design like in previous checkpoints.

== Assignment Structure

For information on all classes present after the completion of Checkpoint 3,
refer to our
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2020-MP-Writeups/3/overview-summary.html[official
Javadoc].

=== Obtaining MP3

To update your project with the remote and get started on MP3, follow these instructions:

. **Get the remote code.**
//
Select _VCS | Git | Fetch_ from the menu to download the remote commit.
//
However, it still needs to be merged with your work.
//
. **Merge the changes!**
//
Now we need to merge the changes from your computer with our remote repository,
so go back to the menu and choose _VCS | Git | Merge Changes_.
//
Check the `remotes/release/mp3` branch you just fetched and press Merge!
//
The Version Control pane will appear to inform you of items updated from the
server.
//
. **Update `grade.yaml`.**
//
Open the file in the root of the project, change the `checkpoint` setting to
`3`, and do _File | Sync Project with Gradle Files_.

=== Late Submissions

Like in previous checkpoints, setting `useProvided` in `grade.yaml` to `true`
causes the app to use our provided components rather than your implementations.
//
For Checkpoint 3, we provide `TargetVisitChecker` (with both MP0-style and
refactored signatures), `AreaDivider`, the launch activity, the main activity,
and the gameplay logic in `GameActivity`.

As usual, you can always go back and make submissions to previous checkpoints by
changing `checkpoint` in `grade.yaml`.
//
However, merging MP3 will produce compilation errors until you add the classes
expected by the new test suite.

== Tools and Resources

This section provides you with tools and information that you will need to complete the
features in <<goal, Your Goal>>.

[[lists]]
//
=== Lists

Java arrays are useful for storing multiple values of the same type, but an
array's length cannot be changed after its creation.
//
Often it's not known in advance how many entries a collection will have, or the
collection has items added to or removed from it.
//
In those situations, arrays are inconvenient.

Fortunately, Java provides _lists_: objects that hold dynamically resizable
lists of things.
//
All lists are instances of
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html[`List`],
//
but `List` is an interface rather than a concrete type.
//
To create a list you create an instance of a `List` implementation, the most
common of which is
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html[`ArrayList`].
//
This is an example of _polymorphism_.

When you declared arrays, you put the element type before square brackets, like
`String[]` for an array of strings.
//
List variables are declared like `List<String>`, with the element type in angle
brackets.
//
To declare a list-of-strings variable and initialize it to an empty `ArrayList`,
you would use code like this:

[source,java]
----
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
----

The angle brackets on the right side of the assignment can be empty, which means
that the actual list object created holds the same type of values as the
variable is declared to contain.

The `List` type defines many functions that are usable on all lists.
//
The most useful ones are:

* `add`, which adds one element to the end of the list (increasing its size by
one)
//
* `size`, which returns the current length of the list
//
* `get`, which gets the element at the specified position in the list
//
* `remove`, which removes an element from the list (decreasing its size by one)

For example:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 0 - the list is empty initially
names.add("Chuchu");
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 1 - now the list has one element
names.add("Xyz");
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 2 - now the list has two elements
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Prints "Chuchu", the first element in the list
names.remove("Chuchu");
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Prints "Xyz", the first element now that Chuchu was removed
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 1 - the list has one element anymore
----

Lists can be iterated over with the enhanced for loop:

[source,java]
----
for (String name : names) {
    // Do something with name?
}
----

Types like `List` and `ArrayList` will need to be imported before you can use
them.
//
Android Studio can help with this.
//
If you press Tab to autocomplete a type name, any needed import statement will
automatically be added at the top of the file.

[[gson]]
//
=== Writing JSON with Gson

In Checkpoint 2, you
//
link:/MP/2/#_using_gson[used Gson to read data]
//
from parsed JSON.
//
In this checkpoint, you'll need to create JSON objects to send to the server.

Gson can help with this too.
//
To create a new JSON object, use `new JsonObject()`.
//
To add a single, simple value like a string or number as a property on an
object, call the object's `addProperty` function, passing the property name and
value.
//
For example, this code builds a `JsonObject` corresponding to
//
link:/MP/2/#_what_is_json[the first MP2 JSON example]:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject point = new JsonObject();
point.addProperty("latitude", 40.109187);
point.addProperty("longitude", -88.227213);
----

To add a more complicated value like an array or other object as a property of
an object, use `add` instead.

Likewise, to create a JSON array, use `new JsonArray()`.
//
Its `add` function will add an entry to the end of the array.

This code reconstitutes the more complicated JSON object from the MP2 writeup:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject cs125 = new JsonObject();
cs125.addProperty("name", "CS 125");
cs125.addProperty("enrollment", 800);

JsonObject location = new JsonObject();
location.addProperty("name", "Foellinger Auditorium");
location.addProperty("allows_food", false);
location.addProperty("latitude", 40.105952);
location.addProperty("longitude", -88.227204);
cs125.add("location", location);

JsonArray lectureDays = new JsonArray();
lectureDays.add("Monday");
lectureDays.add("Wednesday");
lectureDays.add("Friday");
cs125.add("lecture_days", lectureDays);
----

Gson objects stringify to the JSON text they represent, so you can pass them to
`System.out.println` to see what JSON you've built.
//
It will be condensed onto one line and difficult to read, so you may find it
helpful to paste that into
//
https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print[a JSON formatter]
//
to see its structure more easily.

[[api]]
//
=== Our API Documentation

To create a multiplayer game, the app makes a POST request to our
`/games/create` endpoint.
//
Since there is a lot of game information rather than just a game ID, the game
configuration will need to be uploaded to the server as the body (_payload_) of
the request.
//
The body will be a JSON object (Gson `JsonObject` instance) with these
properties:

* `mode` (string) is the game mode, either "target" or "area"
//
* `invitees` (array of objects) is the list of players invited to the game,
including the user. Each object should have these properties:
//
- `email` (string) is the invitee's email address
//
- `team` (integer) is the `TeamID` code for the role/team the user is invited to
//
* _For target mode only_, `proximityThreshold` (integer) is the proximity
threshold in meters
//
* _For target mode only_, `targets` (array of objects) is the list of targets in
the game. Each object should have these properties:
//
- `latitude` (double) is the latitude of the target
//
- `longitude` (double) is the longitude of the target
//
* _For area mode only_, `cellSize` (integer) is the cell size in meters
//
* _For area mode only_, `areaNorth`, `areaEast`, `areaSouth`, and `areaWest`
(all doubles) are the latitude/longitude bounds of the area

You may find the
//
**link:/MP/files/MP3/target.json[example target mode body]** and
//
**link:/MP/files/MP3/area.json[example area mode body]** helpful.

If the game is created successfully, the server's response will be a JSON object
with a single `game` property whose value is the (string) game ID.
//
Our provided code uses this to launch `GameActivity`.

[[presets_api]]
//
=== Extra Credit API Documentation

If you are attempting the extra credit feature to allow the user to load a
predefined set of targets, your app will need to be able to fetch the preset
targets lists from the server.
//
Those are accessible by a GET request to the `/presets` endpoint.
//
The server's response will be a JSON object containing this property:

* `presets` (array of objects) is the list of preset options. Each object has
these properties:
//
- `name` (string) is the human-readable name of the preset
//
- `targets` (array of objects) is the list of targets in the preset. Each has at
  least these properties:
//
** `latitude` (double) is the target's latitude
//
** `longitude` (double) is the target's longitude

You may find
//
link:/MP/files/MP3/presets.json[this example response]
//
helpful.
//
Do not assume that the `note` property will always be present on target objects,
but feel free to do anything you like with it if it's there.
//
You can always ignore it completely.

[[git_revert]]
//
=== Reverting Changes with Git

++++
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FQBTwwFX0I8" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
++++

Version control systems like Git make it possible to retrieve older versions of
your code, which is very useful if you accidentally damage a file.
//
Android Studio integrates with Git to allow you to undo (_revert_) changes with
its UI.

If you would like to put a file back to how it was at the last commit,
right-click it in the Project pane and choose _Git | Revert_.
//
This brings up the Revert Changes dialog, where you can select any additional
files you would like to revert.
//
Reverting a file throws away all changes to it since the last commit and **is
usually not reversible**.

For a more surgical approach, Android Studio highlights changed regions of files
with colored bars or gray triangles in the left margin of the code editor.
//
Clicking one of these decorations produces a toolbar with a back arrow (Rollback
Lines) button that reverts just the highlighted lines to how they were in the
last commit.
//
This rollback method may sometimes be reversible with Ctrl+Z, but you should
still be certain that you want to throw away your changes.

[[goal]]
//
== Your Goal

When you're done with Checkpoint 3, creating a game will upload its
configuration to the server and make it visible to the invitees, who can then
accept or decline the invitation using their app.
//
The game setup activity will show only the settings for the selected game mode.

</div>

[[target]]
//
=== The `Target` Class

The new test suite, `Checkpoint3Test`, is initially unable to compile because it
refers to a `Target` class in the `logic` subdirectory that does not _yet_
exist, so this must be fixed first.
//
We will be using the `Target` class primarily in the next checkpoint to help
manage a target marker on the map, since the Checkpoint 0 approach of passing
coordinates to a `changeMarkerColor` function is unwieldy
//
footnote:[and somewhat error-prone, as some noticed during MP0].

Create the class by right-clicking the `logic` subfolder within the package,
choosing _New | Java Class_, entering `Target` in the Name field, and clicking
OK.
//
We also expect a `GameSetup` logic class, described in the next section, that
you will need to similarly create before your code can compile.
//
You don't need to _implement_ all the functionality at once, but you should
create functions to match the Javadoc so you can get the tests running.

[.alert.alert-warning]
//
--
//
Be sure that the files were created inside the `logic` subpackage and that they
were added to Git.
//
If they are not, your code may not be seen during official grading.
//
--

**To see the needed public members of this class**, refer to
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2020-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2020/mp/logic/Target.html[our official Javadoc].
//
You will need to store a Google Maps
//
https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker.html[`Marker`]
//
object in a private instance variable.

To place a marker on a Google map, use the map's `addMarker` function
//
footnote:[like the provided `placeMarker` function in `GameActivity` does]:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose position is a LatLng variable
MarkerOptions options = new MarkerOptions().position(position);
// Set any other options you like?
Marker marker = map.addMarker(options);
----

To change the color of a marker after it has been created, use its `setIcon`
function
//
footnote:[like `changeMarkerColor` in `GameActivity` does]:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose hue is a hue value like the constants defined on BitmapDescriptorFactory
BitmapDescriptor icon = BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(hue);
marker.setIcon(icon);
----

You can refer to
//
https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/BitmapDescriptorFactory[this Android article]
//
to check out the different `HUE_` constants to use in `Target.java`.

After completing this task, `testTargetClass` will pass.
//
You may _optionally_ rework your target mode logic in `GameActivity` to take
advantage of this new class, but otherwise you will not need it again in this
checkpoint.

[[latlng]]
//
=== `LatLng` Refactor

Functions that take eight parameters, especially all of the same type, can be
difficult to use.
//
This is even more unfortunate when some of the parameters really belong
together, packaged up into objects.
//
Now that you know how to use objects like the Google Maps SDK's `LatLng`, we've
rewritten `LinesCrossDetector.linesCross` to accept the lines' endpoints as
`LatLng` objects
//
footnote:[In fact, ``checkstyle``'s default configuration forbids functions with
more than seven parameters.
//
We had to change that to allow our original version of this function.].

You need to copy the new version from
//
https://gist.github.com/Fleex255/d11e2d1344b5a7a52ec8dd6941d0e2f5[this GitHub
Gist]
//
over your current `LineCrossDetector` so that `linesCross` can be called with
four ``LatLng`` positions.
//
You will also need to update the places in your code that call it to match.

Similarly refactor the `addLine` function in `GameActivity` to take two `LatLng`
endpoints rather than four `double` coordinates.
//
You will need to update the function's callers to be compatible with its new
signature.
//
Once you complete these tasks, `testLatLngRefactor` will pass.

If you make a mistake while refactoring and want to put a file back to how it was
at the last commit, see the section on <<git_revert, reverting changes>>.

==== Optional: Refactoring `TargetVisitChecker`

If you would like to, you may refactor your `TargetVisitChecker` methods to take
a `LatLng[]` in place of the two ``double[]``s.
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2020-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2020/mp/logic/TargetVisitChecker.html[Updated Javadoc] is available.
//
The Checkpoint 0 tests are forward-compatible with this change.
//
After doing that, you'll probably want to use the `getPositions` function of
`DefaultTargets` rather than `getLatitudes` and `getLongitudes` in your
`GameActivity` target mode setup.

Better yet, you may take advantage of your new list skills to keep track of the
target mode game state entirely inside `GameActivity`.
//
If `TargetVisitChecker` is removed, the Checkpoint 0 test results will be
all-or-nothing based on the result of `testTargetModeGameplay`.

`TargetVisitChecker` will be removed entirely in the next checkpoint and
`GameActivity` will be significantly remodeled then, so don't get too attached
to either.

This section of refactoring is **not required and will not be graded**, but it
is encouraged to practice changing your code, as it is a necessary real-world
skill!

[[game_setup]]
//
=== The `GameSetup` Class

You will need to create a `GameSetup` class in the `logic` subfolder.
//
This class will contain two static helper methods that take the app's current
game information and convert all the data into a JSON payload that can be sent
in a POST request.

Remember to follow the documentation for <<Our API Documentation, our API>> so
that when you write properties and values into your `JsonObject`, they match the
naming and type conventions that we've specified.
//
Some of the parameters passed to your functions are ``List``s.
//
You will need to read from them according to <<lists, our list introduction>>
but should not need to modify them or create new lists here.

You can refer to the Javadoc for the class
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2020-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2020/mp/logic/GameSetup.html[here].
//
Be sure to implement both listed functions, but you are encouraged to add helper
functions as you design your logic.

Once the functions are fully implemented, `GameSetup` will be able to create
JSON objects representing the configuration of a multiplayer target game or area
game.
//
`testJsonTargetMode` and `testJsonAreaMode` respectively will then pass.

=== Game Setup UI

The game configuration screen allows the user to select their desired game mode
(area or target) and set other parameters like the cell size or proximity
threshold.
//
This screen's layout is `activity_new_game.xml` and its Java class is
`NewGameActivity`.

Our layout contains a `RadioGroup` with ID `gameModeGroup`.
//
Inside this `RadioGroup` are two ``RadioButton``s.
//
One has ID `targetModeOption` and the other has ID `areaModeOption`.
//
The user will use these to pick the game mode.

Some settings only make sense for one game mode, so they shouldn't be shown all
the time.
//
For example, the user shouldn't see a setting for proximity threshold when
setting up an area mode game.
//
To allow showing and hiding the different game-mode-specific settings as a unit,
we've organized the views into containers.
//
There is a `LinearLayout` with the ID `areaSettings`.
//
If the user chooses to play a game in target mode, this `LinearLayout` should
disappear.
//
Otherwise, the user will use this settings container to configure their game.
//
For target mode settings, we've added another container with ID
`targetSettings`.

To make the radio buttons change the containers' visibility, we need to add code
to `NewGameActivity`.
//
In `onCreate`, attach a handler that will be run when the selected radio button
in the `RadioGroup` is changed:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose modeGroup is a RadioGroup variable (maybe an instance variable?)
modeGroup = findViewById(R.id.gameModeGroup);
modeGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener((unused, checkedId) -> {
    // checkedId is the R.id constant of the currently checked RadioButton
    // Your code here: make only the selected mode's settings group visible
});
----

Each mode's settings group should be shown only when its option is selected.
//
Each settings group should be `View.GONE` initially and when its mode is not
selected.
//
After you make this so, `testSettingsGroupVisibility` will pass.

[[presets]]
=== Extra Credit: Target Presets

**Challenge problem!**
//
This is extra credit because it takes a bit more work and tinkering.
//
It can be done before the game creation API request and before you complete the
`RadioGroup` visibility modifications, so feel free to tackle this early on!

Many users won't want to spend a lot of time picking out enough targets for an
interesting target mode game.
//
To make it easier to add a set of targets, the app could have several suggested
lists of targets and allow the user to add an entire suggested list at once.

Inside the target mode settings group, we have added a "Load Preset" with ID
`loadPresetTargets`.
//
When it is clicked, you need to fetch the <<presets_api, list of presets from
the server>>.
//
When the request completes, create and show an `AlertDialog` to list the
options.
//
Refer to Android's
//
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#AlertDialog[`AlertDialog`
guide]
//
for details.

We have provided a `chunk_presets_list.xml` layout resource which you can inflate
//
footnote:[like the provided code in Checkpoint 2 did with the game information chunks]
//
_with a null parent_
//
footnote:[Android Studio will warn about that, but it's OK&mdash;this is the one
place in Android where it's acceptable and necessary to pass a null root.]
//
and pass to the dialog builder's `setView` function.
//
For each preset option, add a `RadioButton`
inside the provided `RadioGroup` (ID `presetOptions`), with the radio button's text set to the
preset's name.
//
This is the one place in the MP where you should create an individual view
dynamically using `new`.
//
The constructors for most Android views take a context, which can be
the activity: `this` footnote:[or `NewGameActivity.this` if inside a non-concise handler].

The alert dialog's positive button should be labeled "Load".
//
Its negative button should be labeled "Cancel."
//
The dialog might look like this:

image::LoadPreset.png[a list of preset options]

If the positive button (Load) is pressed with a preset selected, all existing
targets should be removed and all the targets from the selected preset should be
added.
//
There are multiple ways to associate a preset with a radio button&mdash;you may
find `getTag` and `setTag` helpful.
//
If the user presses Cancel or presses Load without selecting a preset, do
nothing and the dialog will be dismissed by default.

If you complete this task, `testTargetPresets_extraCredit` will pass and you'll
have earned 20% extra credit!

[[grading]]
//
== Grading

As always, 100 points is full credit on the checkpoint.
//
But on MP3 there are **120** points available, broken down as follows:

* **15 points** for the `Target` class
//
* **15 points** for refactoring `addLine` and `LineCrossDetector`
//
* **10 points** for making the radio buttons in `NewGameActivity` control
settings group visibility
//
* **25 points** for `areaMode` in `GameSetup`
//
* **25 points** for `targetMode` in `GameSetup`
//
* **20 points** of _extra credit_ for the _optional_ Load Preset feature
//
* **10 points** for passing `checkstyle` inspection

If you missed a deadline in a previous checkpoint, doing the extra credit here
is a great way to earn some of those points back!

Your app will be tested by `Checkpoint3Test`.
//
Feel free to look through that class's code to see what the test suite tries to
do with your app.
//
Post on the {forum} for clarifications about what exactly is expected.

== Cliffhanger

Because the game setup screen submits the game configuration to the server
instead of passing it to the game activity, gameplay is probably pretty broken
at the moment.
//
In the next and final checkpoint, we'll finish the app by connecting the game
activity to the server!

== Cheating

By now you should be familiar with the
https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/syllabus/#cheating[cheating policies] from
the syllabus.
//
Collaborating in a human language about how to approach the problems is
encouraged, but sharing your code with anyone not currently on the course staff
constitutes cheating.
