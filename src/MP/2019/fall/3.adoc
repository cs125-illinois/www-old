[.lead]
In link:/MP/2019/fall/2[MP2], you connected the app to our game server to get and respond to invitations.
In Checkpoint 3, you'll make it possible to invite people to new multiplayer games and _refactor_
some of your old code to improve it.

When you first started working on the MP, we hadn't covered object-oriented programming yet,
so the target mode functionality had to be implemented using only arrays and imperative programming.
As you discovered, that was not ideal. Programmers often learn or realize better approaches
to problems already solved and revisit old code to improve it.
This process is called _refactoring_. In this checkpoint we'll refactor some of the code
you wrote in MP0 and organize some relevant logic into a class that can more easily be
used in the next checkpoint.

Deadlines for Checkpoint 3 vary by your deadline group. MP3 is due at:

* **8 PM on Sunday, 11/3/2019 for the Blue Group**: all labs starting at 2 PM or earlier
* **8 PM on Monday, 11/4/2019 for the Orange Group**: all labs starting at 3 PM or later

Additionally, 10% of your grade is for submitting code that earns at least _40 points_
by 8 PM on **Sunday 10/27/2019 (Blue)** or **Monday 10/28/2019 (Orange)**.
Late submissions are subject to the link:/info/2019/fall/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

== Learning Objectives

On MP3 you will:

* Work with and improve older code
* Make web requests that deliver additional information to the web API

We will continue to exercise your class design and Android UI skills (including repeatable UI)
like in previous checkpoints.

== Assignment Structure

Like in previous checkpoints, we distribute the new MP3 files in a _patch_ to your existing
repository.

For information on all classes present after the completion of Checkpoint 3,
refer to our
**https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/package-summary.html[official Javadoc]**.

=== Obtaining MP3

To start working on Checkpoint 3, follow these steps:

1. Commit your work just in case you run into any problems applying the patch.
2. Download link:/MP/2019/fall/patches/MP3.patch[the MP3 patch file, download=true].
3. In Android Studio, do _VCS | Apply Patch_.
4. Select the downloaded patch file and press OK to apply it.
5. Change the `checkpoint` setting in `grade.yaml` to `3`.
6. Do _File | Sync Project with Gradle Files_.

A new run configuration called Test Checkpoint 3 will run the Checkpoint 3 test suite.
If you run into a problem obtaining MP3, please get help immediately.

Because the new test suite refers to a class that you need to add, your project will not
be able to compile immediately after applying the patch. This will be fixed as you start
working on the checkpoint as described in <<goal, Your Goal>>.

=== Late Submissions

Like in previous checkpoints, setting `useProvided` in `grade.yaml` to `true`
causes the app to use our provided components rather than your implementations.
For Checkpoint 3, we provide `TargetVisitChecker` (with both MP0-style and refactored signatures),
`AreaDivider`, the launch activity, the main activity, the local game setup UI in `NewGameActivity`,
and the gameplay logic in `GameActivity`.

If you didn't finish the game setup activity in MP1, you can still do MP3.
Our provided components will try to fuse the game setup UI you have with our version of the missing
parts. However, it would be ideal to get `testSetupUI` from MP1 done as soon as possible
so that you can set `useProvided` back to `false`.
If you're curious about how the installation of provided components works,
you can post on the {forum}.

As usual, you can always go back and make submissions to previous checkpoints by changing
`checkpoint` in `grade.yaml`.

== Tools and Resources

This section provides you with tools and information that you will need to complete the
features in <<goal, Your Goal>>.

[[lists]]
=== Lists

Java arrays are useful for storing multiple values of the same type, but an array's length
cannot be changed after its creation. Often it's not known in advance how many entries a collection
will have, or the collection has items added to or removed from it. In those situations, arrays
are inconvenient.

Fortunately, Java provides _lists_: objects that hold dynamically resizable lists of things.
All lists are instances of
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html[`List`], but `List` is an
interface rather than a concrete type.
To create a list you create an instance of a `List` implementation, the most common of which is
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html[`ArrayList`].
This is an example of _polymorphism_.

When you declared arrays, you put the element type before square brackets, like `String[]` for
an array of strings. List variables are declared like `List<String>`, with the element type
in angle brackets. To declare a list-of-strings variable and initialize it to an empty
`ArrayList`, you would use code like this:

[source,java]
----
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
----

The angle brackets on the right side of the assignment can be empty, which means that
the actual list object created holds the same type of values as the variable is declared to contain.

The `List` type defines many functions that are usable on all lists. The most useful ones are:

* `add`, which adds one element to the end of the list (increasing its size by one)
* `size`, which returns the current length of the list
* `get`, which gets the element at the specified position in the list
* `remove`, which removes an element from the list (decreasing its size by one)

For example:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 0 - the list is empty initially
names.add("Chuchu");
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 1 - now the list has one element
names.add("Xyz");
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 2 - now the list has two elements
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Prints "Chuchu", the first element in the list
names.remove("Chuchu");
System.out.println(names.get(0)); // Prints "Xyz", the first element now that Chuchu was removed
System.out.println(names.size()); // Prints 1 - the list has one element anymore
----

Lists can be iterated over with the enhanced for loop:

[source,java]
----
for (String name : names) {
    // Do something with name?
}
----

Types like `List` and `ArrayList` will need to be imported before you can use them.
Android Studio can help with this: if you press Tab to autocomplete a type name, any needed
import statement will automatically be added at the top of the file.

[[spinners]]
=== Spinners

Dropdown lists are useful when the user has a handful of possible choices.
Android provides a `Spinner` control in the Containers tab of the Palette that produces
a dropdown list. It is possible to populate the dropdown dynamically at runtime, but it is much
easier to set the `entries` attribute in the Attributes pane to a string array resource.
Then each string in that array resource will be one entry in the dropdown.

Some useful methods of ``Spinner``s:

* To get the current selection, you can call the `getSelectedItemPosition` function,
which returns the index of the selected item. For example, 0 means that the user selected the
first entry.
* To programmatically change which item is selected, use the `setSelection` function,
which takes the index of the item to select.
* To register a handler that will be run when the user changes the selected item,
use `setOnItemSelectedListener`:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose spinner is a Spinner variable
spinner.setOnItemSelectedListener(new AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onItemSelected(final AdapterView<?> parent, final View view,
                               final int position, final long id) {
        // Called when the user selects a different item in the dropdown
        // The position parameter is the selected index
        // The other parameters can be ignored
    }
    @Override
    public void onNothingSelected(final AdapterView<?> parent) {
        // Called when the selection becomes empty
        // Not relevant to the MP - can be left blank
    }
});
----

If you'd like more information, you can see
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/controls/spinner[Android's guide to spinners].

[[gson]]
=== Writing JSON with Gson

In Checkpoint 2, you link:/MP/2019/fall/2/#_using_gson[used Gson to read data] from parsed JSON.
In this checkpoint, you'll need to create JSON objects to send to the server.

Gson can help with this too. To create a new JSON object, use `new JsonObject()`.
To add a single, simple value like a string or number as a property on an object, call the object's
`addProperty`  function, passing the property name and value. For example, this code builds
a `JsonObject` corresponding to link:/MP/2019/fall/2/#_what_is_json[the first MP2 JSON example]:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject point = new JsonObject();
point.addProperty("latitude", 40.109187);
point.addProperty("longitude", -88.227213);
----

To add a more complicated value like an array or other object as a property of an object, use
`add` instead.

Likewise, to create a JSON array, use `new JsonArray()`. Its `add` function will add an entry to the
end of the array.

This code reconstitutes the more complicated JSON object from the MP2 writeup:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject cs125 = new JsonObject();
cs125.addProperty("name", "CS 125");
cs125.addProperty("enrollment", 800);

JsonObject location = new JsonObject();
location.addProperty("name", "Foellinger Auditorium");
location.addProperty("allows_food", false);
location.addProperty("latitude", 40.105952);
location.addProperty("longitude", -88.227204);
cs125.add("location", location);

JsonArray lectureDays = new JsonArray();
lectureDays.add("Monday");
lectureDays.add("Wednesday");
lectureDays.add("Friday");
cs125.add("lecture_days", lectureDays);
----

Gson objects stringify to the JSON text they represent, so you can pass them to
`System.out.println` to see what JSON you've built. It will be condensed onto one line and difficult
to read, so you may find it helpful to paste that into
https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print[a JSON formatter] to see its structure more easily.

[[api]]
=== Our API Documentation

To create a multiplayer game, your app will need to make a POST request to the `/games/create`
endpoint. Since there is a lot of game information rather than just a game ID, the game
configuration will need to be uploaded to the server as the body (_payload_) of the request.
The body should be a JSON object (Gson `JsonObject` instance) with these properties:

* `mode` (string) is the game mode, either "target" or "area"
* `invitees` (array of objects) is the list of players invited to the game, including the user;
each object should have these properties:
- `email` (string) is the invitee's email address
- `team` (integer) is the `TeamID` code for the role/team the user is invited to
* _For target mode only_, `proximityThreshold` (integer) is the proximity threshold in meters
* _For target mode only_, `targets` (array of objects) is the list of targets in the game;
each object should have these properties:
- `latitude` (double) is the latitude of the target
- `longitude` (double) is the longitude of the target
* _For area mode only_, `cellSize` (integer) is the cell size in meters
* _For area mode only_, `areaNorth`, `areaEast`, `areaSouth`, and `areaWest` (all doubles)
are the latitude/longitude bounds of the area

You may find the **link:/MP/2019/fall/files/MP3/target.json[example target mode body]** and
**link:/MP/2019/fall/files/MP3/area.json[example area mode body]** helpful.

If the game is created successfully, the server's response will be a JSON object with a single
`game` property whose value is the (string) game ID.

If the game cannot be created, your error handler will be run. The `getMessage` function on
the error object returns a human-readable string describing the problem.

[[presets_api]]
=== Extra Credit API Documentation

If you are attempting the extra credit feature to allow the user to load a predefined
set of targets, your app will need to be able to fetch the preset
targets lists from the server. Those are accessible by a GET request to the `/presets` endpoint.
The server's response will be a JSON object containing this property:

* `presets` (array of objects) is the list of preset options; each object has these properties:
- `name` (string) is the human-readable name of the preset
- `targets` (array of objects) is the list of targets in the preset; each has at least these
properties:
** `latitude` (double) is the target's latitude
** `longitude` (double) is the target's longitude

You may find **link:/MP/2019/fall/files/MP3/presets.json[this example response]** helpful.
Do not assume that the `note` property will always be present on target objects,
but feel free to do anything you like with it if it's there. You can always ignore it completely.

[[git_revert]]
=== Reverting Changes with Git

Version control systems like Git make it possible to retrieve older versions
of your code, which is very useful if you accidentally damage a file.
Android Studio integrates with Git to allow you to undo (_revert_) changes with its UI.

If you would like to put a file back to how it was at the last commit, right-click
it in the Project pane and choose _Git | Revert_. This brings up the Revert Changes
dialog, where you can select any additional files you would like to revert.
Reverting a file throws away all changes to it since the last commit and **is usually not
reversible**.

For a more surgical approach, Android Studio highlights changed regions of files
with colored bars or gray triangles in the left margin of the code editor.
Clicking one of these decorations produces a toolbar with a back arrow (Rollback Lines)
button that reverts just the highlighted lines to how they were in the last commit.
This rollback method may sometimes be reversible with Ctrl+Z, but you should still
be certain that you want to throw away your changes.

[[goal]]
== Your Goal

When you're done with Checkpoint 3, the game setup activity will allow the user to
invite other people and assign their roles/teams. The user will be able to press locations
on a map to specify the targets of a target mode game. Creating a game will upload its
configuration to the server and make it visible to the invitees, who can then accept or decline
the invitation using their app.

While setting up a target mode game, the user might see UI like this:

image::TargetGameSetup.png[completed games lists UI]

A video tour of MP3 created by the CA captains footnote:[narrated by Daniel]
is available:

++++
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/710HVIECocw" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
++++

Unless otherwise noted, you can do these sections in any order.

[[target]]
=== `Target` Class

The new test suite, `Checkpoint3Test`, is initially unable to compile because it refers to a
`Target` class which does not exist, so this must be fixed first.
We will be using the `Target` class primarily in the
next checkpoint to help manage a target marker on the map,
since the Checkpoint 0 approach of passing coordinates to a
`changeMarkerColor` function is unwieldy footnote:[and somewhat error-prone, as some noticed
during MP0].

Create the class by right-clicking the package containing all your other Java source files,
choosing _New | Java Class_, entering `Target` in the Name field, and clicking OK.

[.alert.alert-warning]
--
Like in previous checkpoints, make sure that the file was created inside our package in the
`main` source set and that it was added to Git.
--

**To see the needed public members of this class**, refer to
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/Target.html[our official Javadoc].
You will need to store a Google Maps
https://developers.google.com/android/reference/com/google/android/gms/maps/model/Marker.html[`Marker`]
object in a private instance variable.

To place a marker on a Google map, use the map's `addMarker` function
footnote:[like the provided `placeMarker` function in `GameActivity` does]:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose position is a LatLng variable
MarkerOptions options = new MarkerOptions().position(position);
// Set any other options you like?
Marker marker = map.addMarker(options);
----

To change the color of a marker after it has been created, use its `setIcon`
function footnote:[like `changeMarkerColor` in `GameActivity` does]:

[source,java]
----
// Suppose hue is a hue value like the constants defined on BitmapDescriptorFactory
BitmapDescriptor icon = BitmapDescriptorFactory.defaultMarker(hue);
marker.setIcon(icon);
----

After completing this task, `testTargetClass` will pass.
You may _optionally_ rework your target mode logic in `GameActivity` to take advantage of this
new class, but otherwise you will not need it again in this checkpoint.

[[latlng]]
=== `LatLng` Refactor

Functions that take eight parameters, especially all of the same type, can be difficult to use.
This is even more unfortunate when some of the parameters really belong together, packaged up
into objects. Now that you know how to use objects like the Google Maps SDK's `LatLng`,
we've rewritten `LinesCrossDetector.linesCross` to accept the lines' endpoints as `LatLng`
objects.
footnote:[In fact, ``checkstyle``'s default configuration forbids functions with more
than seven parameters; we had to change that to allow our original version of this function.]

Download
link:/MP/2019/fall/patches/MP3-LineCrossDetector.patch[the `LineCrossDetector` patch, download=true]
and apply it with _VCS | Apply Patch_ like you do with the checkpoint patches.
This will introduce compilation errors in your functions that use `linesCross`!
You need to adjust those to use the
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/LineCrossDetector.html#linesCross-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-[improved version's signature],
calling it with four ``LatLng`` positions.

[.alert.alert-warning]
--
**If Android Studio is unable to apply the patch** due to how you fixed the `checkstyle`
errors in Checkpoint 0, or if there are compilation errors _inside_ `LineCrossDetector`,
you can instead copy-paste the updated class from
https://gist.github.com/Fleex255/f47ed822be5f0054cfc0e7827eb38d7e[this Gist].
--

Similarly refactor the
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/GameActivity.html#addLine-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-com.google.android.gms.maps.model.LatLng-int-[`addLine` function]
in `GameActivity` to take two `LatLng` endpoints rather than four `double` coordinates.
You will need to update the function's callers to be compatible with its new signature.

If you make a mistake while refactoring and want to put a file back to how it was
at the last commit, see the section on <<git_revert, reverting changes>>.

After completing these tasks, `testLatLngRefactor` will pass.

[[extra_refactoring]]
==== Extra Refactoring Practice

You may _optionally_ refactor your `TargetVisitChecker` methods to take a `LatLng[]` in place
of the two ``double[]``s.
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/TargetVisitChecker.html[Updated Javadoc]
is available. The Checkpoint 0 tests are forward-compatible with this change.
After doing that, you'll probably want to use the `getPositions` function of `DefaultTargets`
rather than `getLatitudes` and `getLongitudes` in your `GameActivity` target mode setup.

Better yet, you may take advantage of your new list skills to keep track of the target mode
game state entirely inside `GameActivity`.
If `TargetVisitChecker` is removed, the Checkpoint 0 test results will be all-or-nothing
based on the result of `testTargetModeGameplay`.

`TargetVisitChecker` will be removed entirely in the next checkpoint and `GameActivity` will be
significantly remodeled then, so don't get too attached to either.

[[target_map]]
=== Targets Map

In Checkpoint 1 you made it possible for the user to select the area for area mode by panning
and zooming a Google Maps control. Now you'll add a similar map control that allows the user
to choose the targets for a target mode game by pressing to add a target and clicking a target
to remove it.

To add another map to the game setup activity, open `activity_new_game.xml` in the UI designer,
copy the `areaSizeMap` fragment, paste it inside the target mode settings layout
footnote:[the `LinearLayout` with ID `targetSettings`], and change the
copy's ID to `targetsMap`.

In ``NewGameActivity``'s `onCreate` we provided this chunk of code:

[source,java]
----
SupportMapFragment areaMapFragment = (SupportMapFragment) getSupportFragmentManager()
        .findFragmentById(R.id.areaSizeMap);
areaMapFragment.getMapAsync(newMap -> {
    areaMap = newMap;
    centerMap(areaMap);
});
----

This gets a reference to the `areaSizeMap` fragment and registers a handler that will be run
when Google Maps creates the map. When the map is available (in `getMapAsync`), it is stored
in the instance variable `areaMap` and passed to our `centerMap` function for centering on
Campustown.

Declare another instance variable to store the targets map, then duplicate the above section of
code to similarly prepare your `targetsMap` fragment. Make sure to change the `findFragmentById`
parameter to operate on your new fragment. You'll then be able to see in the app that
the map that appears for target mode setup is centered on Campustown just like the area mode setup
one.

To keep track of the targets added so far, declare an instance variable to hold a
list of Google Maps markers: a `List<Marker>`. Initialize it to a new, empty <<lists, list>>.
Add some code to your new `getMapAsync` handler to make the user's actions on the map
add targets:

* Register a long-press handler on the targets map by calling `setOnMapLongClickListener`.
The handler receives a `LatLng` object specifying the point that was pressed. When that happens,
create a marker at that position and add it to the list. Again see the implementation of the
`placeMarker` function in `GameActivity` for how to place a marker on a map.
* Likewise register a `setOnMarkerClickListener` handler, which is passed a `Marker` that the user
clicked. Remove that marker from the map by calling its `remove` function and remove it from the
targets list you declared as an instance variable.

In summary, you'll want code like this inside the new `getMapAsync`:

[source,java]
----
targetMap.setOnMapLongClickListener(location -> {
    // Code here runs whenever the user presses on the map.
    // location is the LatLng position where the user pressed.
    // 1. Create a Google Maps Marker at the provided coordinates.
    // 2. Add it to your targets list instance variable.
});

targetMap.setOnMarkerClickListener(clickedMarker -> {
    // Code here runs whenever the user taps a marker.
    // clickedMarker is the Marker object the user clicked.
    // 1. Remove the marker from the map with its remove function.
    // 2. Remove it from your targets list.
    return true; // This makes Google Maps not pan the map again
});
----

After completing this task, `testTargetMap` will pass.

[[invitees]]
=== Invitees UI

When setting up a game, the user should be able to decide who is invited to the game
and what roles they have. An invitee can be added by entering their email into a text box
and pressing the Add button. All players (users involved in or invited to the game, including the
app's user), should be shown in a list with a dropdown to set the role, which defaults to observer.
It should be possible to remove an invitee&mdash;but not the user&mdash;by pressing the
Remove button in their row.

To make this possible, we will need three new UI elements in `activity_new_game.xml`:

1. An email text box (from the Text tab) with ID `newInviteeEmail` to allow the user to
enter an invitee's email
2. A button with ID `addInvitee` to actually add the invitee to the list
3. An initially **empty** vertical `LinearLayout` with ID `playersList` to hold the list of players

To display one player entry, we have provided `chunk_invitee.xml` in the patch.
You do not need to modify it, though you may customize it if you like.
To store information about one player, we have provided the
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall2019-MP-Writeups/3/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/fall2019/mp/Invitee.html[`Invitee`]
class. These will be used in `NewGameActivity` to make the invitees UI work.

Add an instance variable to `NewGameActivity` to store the list of players, that is,
a `List<Invitee>`. `onCreate` should initialize it to an empty list and then add
an `Invitee` representing the user with the role of observer.
You should create two helper functions to make the players list UI work:

==== Update Players UI

This function is responsible for repopulating the players list in the UI with the information
stored in the players list instance variable.

First it should `removeAllViews` from the players `LinearLayout`.
Then, much like in Checkpoint 2, it should go through the list variable and
link:/MP/2019/fall/2/#_inflating_layouts[add a chunk] to the `LinearLayout`
for each player. We provided three views in that chunk:

* `inviteeEmail` is a `TextView` whose text should be set to the player's email.
* `inviteeTeam` is a `Spinner` to let the user see and change the player's role.
Its selection should be set to the player object's team ID. When its selection is changed by
the user, the player object's team ID should be updated to match. See our <<spinners, guide
to the relevant spinner functions>>.
* `removeButton` is a `Button` that removes the invitee. It should be gone for the first entry
in the list (the user, since the user shouldn't able to leave their own game). When clicked,
it should remove the player object from the list variable and refresh the players UI list.

When accessing these views, make sure to call `findViewById` on the chunk you inflated
inside your loop so that you get a reference to the view from the specific chunk you're
currently building.

This function should be called by `onCreate` after adding the user to the players list variable so that
the initial UI is set up and the user can choose their own role.

==== Add Invitee

This function should be called when the user presses the `addInvitee` button.

If the `newInviteeEmail` text box is not empty, a new invitee object with the entered email address
and the role of observer should be added to the players list instance variable.
The email text box should be made empty so that the user can enter the next invitee.
Then the players UI should be updated by calling the other helper function so that the change is visible.

After completing this task, `testInvitees` will pass.

[[post_request]]
=== Game Creation API Request

The targets map and invitees UI can be done in either order. Once they're both ready,
the data they solicit from the user can be submitted to the server to create a multiplayer game.

When the Create Game button is clicked, <<gson, build a `JsonObject`>> according to
<<api, our API documentation>> for the game creation endpoint. You will need to include:

* the configuration you made possible in Checkpoint 1, plus
* data from the targets map (if in target mode) and
* players/invitees list.

Much of your Checkpoint 1 logic can still be used; you're just putting the data
in a JSON object rather than an intent.

When your game JSON object is ready, POST it to the game creation endpoint.
If the request succeeds, launch `GameActivity` passing the game ID from the response as the
`game` extra of the intent, then finish `NewGameActivity`.
If the request fails, show a
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts[toast]
(like in the https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/MP/2019/fall/2/#_making_web_requests[example web request]'s
error "handler") that displays the error's message footnote:[from the `getMessage` function
of the error object] so the user knows what went wrong.

Note that `GameActivity` should only be launched once the request completes, not immediately
when the user presses the button. The Checkpoint 1 data no longer needs to go in the intent,
though you can put it there if you'd like the game to keep working in the meantime before
Checkpoint 4 fixes everything.

After completing this task, `testApiRequest` will pass. Nice work!
If you're up for a challenge, you can continue on to the extra credit section below.

=== Extra Credit: Target Presets

**Challenge problem!** This is extra credit because it takes a bit more work and tinkering.
It can be done before the game creation API request, but you will need to have the targets
map working first.

Many users won't want to spend a lot of time picking out enough targets for an interesting
target mode game. To make it easier to add a set of targets, the app could have several
suggested lists of targets and allow the user to add an entire suggested list at once.

Inside the target mode settings group, add a button with text "Load Preset" and ID
`loadPresetTargets`. When it is clicked, fetch the <<presets_api, list of presets from the server>>.
When the request completes, create and show an `AlertDialog` to list the options.
Refer to Android's
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#AlertDialog[`AlertDialog` guide]
for details.

link:/MP/2019/fall/patches/MP3-Chunk.patch[This patch]
provides a `chunk_presets_list.xml` layout resource which you can inflate _with a null parent_
footnote:[Android Studio will warn about that, but it's OK&mdash;this is the one
place in Android where it's acceptable and necessary to pass a null root.]
and pass to the dialog builder's `setView` function. For each preset option, add a `RadioButton`
inside the provided `RadioGroup` (ID `presetOptions`), with the radio button's text set to the
preset's name. This is the one place in the MP where you should create an individual view
dynamically using `new`. The constructors for most Android views take a context, which can be
the activity: `this`.

The alert dialog's positive button should be labeled "Load"; its negative button should be labeled
"Cancel." The dialog might look like this:

image::LoadPreset.png[a list of preset options]

If the positive button (Load) is pressed with a preset selected, all existing targets
should be removed and all the targets from the selected preset should be added.
There are multiple ways to associate a preset with a radio button; you may find `getTag`
and `setTag` helpful. If the user presses Cancel or presses Load without selecting a preset,
do nothing and the dialog will be dismissed by default.

If you complete this task, `testTargetPresets_extraCredit` will pass and you'll have earned
20% extra credit!

[[grading]]
== Grading

As always, 100 points is full credit on the checkpoint.
But on MP3 there are **120** points available, broken down as follows:

* **15 points** for the `Target` class
* **10 points** for refactoring `addLine` and the uses of `LineCrossDetector`
* **15 points** for the targets map
* **20 points** for the invitees UI
* **20 points** for the create-game web request
* **20 points** of _extra credit_ for the _optional_ Load Preset feature
* **10 points** for passing `checkstyle` inspection
* **10 points** for submitting footnote:[by committing and pushing]
code that earns 40 points by 8 PM on your early deadline day

If you missed a deadline in a previous checkpoint, doing the extra credit here is a great way
to earn some of those points back!

Your app will be tested by `Checkpoint3Test`. Feel free to look through that class's code
to see what the test suite tries to do with your app. Post on the {forum} for clarifications
about what exactly is expected.

== Cliffhanger

Because the game setup screen submits the game configuration to the server instead of passing
it to the game activity, gameplay is probably pretty broken at the moment.
In the next and final checkpoint, we'll finish the app by connecting the game activity
to the server!

== Cheating

By now you should be familiar with the link:/info/2019/fall/syllabus/#cheating[cheating policies] from
the syllabus. Collaborating in a human language about how to approach the problems is encouraged,
but sharing your code with anyone not currently on the course staff constitutes cheating.
