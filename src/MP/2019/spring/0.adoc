[.lead]
//
Let's start hacking!
//
Our goal with MP0 is to provide a gentle but realistic introduction to Android
development.
//
On one hand, most of the assignment is writing small pieces of code of the kind
you should be increasingly familiar with.
//
On the other hand, MP0 also challenges you to hack on an larger and scarier
chunk of code&mdash;the guts of a simple Android application.
//
It also introduces you to the development workflow we'll use throughout the rest
of the semester.

*MP0 is due Monday 2/4/2019 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP0 is for submitting code that earns at least
_30 points_ by *Friday 2/1/2019 @ 5PM.*
//
Late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/2019/spring/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

The core objectives of MP0 are both to keep you practicing writing simple
functions _and_ to get you started working with Android.
//
We've brought both of those goals together in the form of location tracking app
which is _almost_ complete but needs a bit of help from you.

Specifically, MP0 continues training you to:

. initialize and use variables and arrays of appropriate types
//
. perform simple calculations using integer and floating point arithmetic
//
. use simple loops and conditional statements to process arrays containing data
//
. translate program descriptions into working code, and
//
. work with test suites as part of your development process.

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

Like all the MPs this semester MP0 is an Android app.
//
It's divided into two parts:

* `/lib/`: a library that performs various computations on location data
collected by the app.
//
* `/app/`: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
//
The Android app is _almost_ complete, but needs a few modifications from you.
//
And, to work correctly, you need to finish the library in `lib`.

_Most_ of the points for MP0 are for completing the three short functions in
`Locator.java` in the library.
//
These problems are a bit of an upgrade from what you have been doing on the
homework, but not a dramatic change.

In contrast, `MainActivity.java` in the app tosses you into the deep end of
Android app development.
//
This is not a complicated app, but it does contain a lot of new ideas and
scary code.
//
Don't worry&mdash;you'll understand all of it by the end of the semester.
//
But the app development part of the MP is designed to force you to get started
on the uncomfortable task of _hacking_ on large pieces of unfamiliar software.

There are a few points for finishing the app, and that only requires _a few_
lines of code footnote:[technically, only one].
//
But you will spend a while poring over the app source code figuring out what on
Earth is going on and what you need to do.
//
Again, this is not uncommon.
//
Modern software development involves working with large codebase with many
contributors, meaning that it is rare to unheard of to understand every last
bit of something you are working on.
//
You may find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2019-MP0-Solution/[MP0 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function and class is supposed to do.

[[preparation]]
=== MP0 Preparation

Before starting MP0 you should make sure that you have completed
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/android-studio[installing Android Studio],
//
and have either an emulator or real device that you can run Android apps on.
//
*If you don't please contact a course staff member immediately.*

Next, work through our instructions on
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git[installing and using Git].
//
We will provide time during lab this week to review how to use Git to submit
MP0, but you are welcome to go through our instructions beforehand if you are
raring to get going.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP0

First,
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git/#account[sign up for a GitHub account]
//
if you haven't already.
//
Then use
//
https://classroom.github.com/a/ygd9hf0i[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to obtain your copy of MP0.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into Android Studio following
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[.alert.alert-danger]
//
--
**Note that the first time you clone MP0 with Android Studio configuration may
appear to fail with an "IDE Error"**.
//
This is OK.
//
Just restart Android Studio at this point and you should be able to continue
working.
//
If that doesn't work check the <<troubleshooting, troubleshooting section
below>>.
--

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

[.lead]
//
Your goal is to complete the helper functions so that the app works properly and
then make _one_ small modifications to the user interface to fix a
non-functional button.

All of the core app code is in `MainActivity.java` in the `app` directory.
//
That's the scary stuff&mdash;although we have tried to comment it heavily to
help you understand what's going on.

But to work properly the app relies on three helper functions from
`Locator.java` in the `lib` directory that process location data:

. `farthestNorth`: given an array of positions, find the one that's the furthest
north.
//
. `beenHere`: given a current position and an array of positions, determine
whether the current position already exists in the array&mdash;meaning that
we've been there before.
//
. `nextRandomLocation`: given a current position, randomly generate a new
position to move to&mdash;or stay put.
//
This is used by a wandering feature of the app designed to help you see how it
works without trekking all over campus.

We have provided test suites for all of the helper functions.
//
Our test suites contains both simple tests for each method for you to use during
development and then a more rigorous set of tests.

Your goal is to correctly implement the missing methods so that all of the tests
pass.
//
Doing so will earn you almost full credit on the assignment&mdash;but see the
section on <<style, style below>>.

[[approach]]
== How to Approach MP0

Although MP0 may seem daunting at first, do not get discouraged!
//
Focus on identifying what you need to do and understanding the requirements of
each function.
//
There is really not a huge amount of code for you to write&mdash;our solution
adds only several dozen lines, although yours may be slightly longer.

=== Understanding What You Need to Do

A core task when approaching any programming assignment or task is to _identify
what you need to do_.
//
To finish the MP0 library there are three&mdash;and only three&mdash;functions
that you need to change.
//
Begin by identifying those functions and understanding their requirements.
//
This will go *a long way* to helping you complete the MP.
//
Once you are done with the library then you can tackle the more daunting change
to `MainActivity.java`.

=== Getting Started

Your initial clone of MP0 will receive 0 points.
//
That's intentional!
//
But once you start working you'll find that your score will go up quickly.
//
You only have to finish _one_ of the helper functions and correct the
`checkstyle` error to get to 30 points by Friday.

Use Android Studio to help you here.
//
It can intelligently identify problems with your MP and guide you toward
solutions.

=== Test-driven Development

We have provided you with testing suites that you can use to perform iterative
test-driven development.
//
You should integrate this process into your normal
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git#workflow[CS 125 Git workflow].
//
Here's how that works:

. Start with one function that you need to write for MP0&mdash;say
`farthestNorth` in `Locator.java`.
//
. Open `Locator.java`.
//
Run the assignment test suite, which is installed as run configuration "Test
Library".
//
Without changes to `Locator.java`, it should fail.
//
. Begin modifying the `farthestNorth` function.
//
When you think that you have a solution, re-run the test suite.
//
Better yet, run just one part of the test suite&mdash;for example, the test
that tests simple inputs to `farthestNorth`.
//
. If the test suite succeeds, you're _almost_ done&mdash;congratulations!
//
. But make sure to run the full grading test suite to ensure that you get full
marks!
//
There may be a case that the simple test suites are not trying that you are not
handling correctly.
//
. If the test suite fails, try to diagnose the problem.
//
Interactive testing can help diagnose these kinds of problems.

In general *the fewer lines of code you write before running a test, the
better.*
//
When you are starting out, it is easy to introduce bugs into your code.
//
Bugs are easiest to catch one-by-one, and so the fewer lines of untested code
the more likely you are to identify errors in your logic or implementation.

=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
//
Please come to link:/info/2019/spring/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post on the
{forum} when you need help.
//
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[android]]
== Android

Android is a Java-based framework for building smartphone apps that run on the
Android platform.
//
By learning how to build Android apps, your programs can have enormous impact.
//
As of a year ago, Google estimated that there were
//
https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/17/2-billion-active-android-devices/[_2
billion_]
//
active Android devices.
//
That's over 25% of people on Earth&mdash;and
//
http://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/[several times more
than iOS].

However, Android is also a huge and complex system.
//
It's easy to feel lost when you are getting started.
//
Our best advice is to just slow down, take a deep breath, and try to understand
a bit of what is going on at a time.
//
We'll try to walk you through a few of the salient bits for MP0 below.
//
Google also maintains a
//
https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2[great set of
tutorials on beginning Android development].

**Note that you will use Android for all MPs this semester and for your final
project**, so put in some time to familiarizing yourself with it now.
//
It's simply the best way to build exciting things in Android&mdash;programs that
you can share with your friends and family.

[[logging]]
=== Logging

Like any other computer program, an important part of developing on Android is
generating debugging output.
//
On Android, our familiar `System.out.println`
//
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220547/why-doesnt-system-out-println-work-in-android[doesn't quite work the same way we're used to].

However, Android has a simple yet powerful _logging_ system.
//
Unlike `System.out.println`, logging systems allow you to specify multiple log
_levels_ indicating the kind of output that you are generating.
//
This allows you to distinguish between, for example, debugging output that might
only be useful during development and a warning message that might indicate a
more serious problem or failure.
//
The Android logger also allows you to attach a `String` _tag_ to each message to
help separate them when you are debugging or developing.
//
So the final syntax of the call to generate a debugging message, for example, is
`Log.d(TAG, message)`.

For more information
// watch the screencast above or review
//
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html[Android's official
logging documentation].

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
//
*Do you need to know this to complete MP0?*
//
Probably, since you need to determine what you app is doing or how things are
going wrong.
//
--

[[activitys]]
=== ``Activity``s and Activity Lifecycle

The Android
//
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html[`Activity` class]
//
corresponds to a single screen that the user can interact with.
//
Our simple app contains only one activity, but most apps consist of several:
maybe an activity corresponding to the app's main screen, another for a
settings dialog, and still others for other parts of the app.

As you might expect, there are a few important moments for an activity: when it
is created, when it appears on the screen, and when it leaves the screen.
//
Android provides functions that you can override to handle both of these events:
`onCreate`, `onResume`, and `onPause`.
//
It is typical for on `onCreate` method to perform tasks required to make the
activity ready for a user to use, such as configuring buttons and other UI
elements.

For more information
//
review
//
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html[Android's
official `Activity` information].

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
//
*Do you need to know this to complete MP0?*
//
No. But you may be confused by the overall app structure if you don't review it.
//
--

[[uievents]]
=== UI Events

Why does code in your app run?
//
In many cases it's because a user _interacted_ with an activity&mdash;clicked a
button, entered text into a dialog box, or adjusted an on-screen control.
//
Android provides a way for each app to register _handlers_: functions that run
when various user interface (UI) events take place.

Our app uses these to:

* enable and disable location tracking
//
* enable and disable randomly-generated fake locations, or _wandering_
//
* center the map&mdash;although this doesn't quite work yet

////
In the
//
<<activitys, screencast on Android ``Activity``s>>
//
above we show how elements of the user interface are linked programmatically to
each specific action.
////

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
//
*Do you need to know this to complete MP0?*
//
Yes!
//
And it will be hard to understand how your app works without reviewing it.
//
--

[[troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

[.lead]
//
When building apps with Android Studio any one of a number of things can go
wrong.
//
We'll try to keep an updated list here of troubleshooting strategies.

=== General Advice

If your app won't build, try the following steps:

. **Restart Android Studio.**
//
Yes, this does in fact sometimes do the trick.
//
. **Invalidate Caches / Restart.**
//
You'll find this under the "File" menu.
//
Again, sometimes it seems to help.
//
. **Rebuild Project.**
//
You'll find this under the "Build" menu.
//
Sometimes rebuilding will help you pinpoint errors that are preventing your app
from starting or the test suites from running.

=== MP0 Specific Advice

We'll add things here as we go, but please check the {forum} first.

[[gradlefix]]
==== Fix `build.gradle`

++++
<div class="row justify-content-center mt-3 mb-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">
      <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/u9w3tvkSwWI" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
++++

The following fix corrects the following error message you may see when you run the test suites:

image::NoTest.png[role='img-fluid']

It also causes Android Studio to correctly display errors when you run the test suites.
//
**So it is important to apply this change!**
//
Read the instructions below or watch the screencast above.
//
If you need help, post on the forum or come to office hours.

To fix this error we're going to make two small changes to your root `build.gradle` file.
//
Here's how to do that.
//
First, switch the left pane to Project view.
//
Next, expand the top (`MP0-Spring2019-`...) folder, then double click `build.gradle`
to open it.
//
**Note that there two other `build.gradle` files in the `app` and `lib` directory.**
//
You do not need to modify these files.

There are _two_ changes you need to make to the file.
//
First, find the part that looks like this at the top:

[source,groovy,role='nonumber']
----
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven {
            url 'https://jitpack.io'
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit:5.2.1.201812262042-r'
        classpath 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradlegrader:0.13.0'
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'
    }
}
----

We want to change the version of our CS 125 grading plugin from `0.13.0` to
`0.13.4`.
//
So change this line:

[source,groovy,role='nonumber']
----
        classpath 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradlegrader:0.13.0'
----

so that it looks like this:

[source,groovy,role='nonumber']
----
        classpath 'com.github.cs125-illinois:gradlegrader:0.13.4'
----

**Android Studio will ask you to sync the Gradle configuration, but don't yet.**
//
Instead, make the next change first.

Next, look at the bottom of the file for the portion that looks like this:

[source,groovy,role='nonumber']
----
tasks.grade.dependsOn('checkstyleMain')
defaultTasks 'grade'
----

Remove the first line.
//
So afterward you should only have:

[source,groovy,role='nonumber']
----
defaultTasks 'grade'
----

**At this point you should use the yellow dialog to sync your Gradle
configuration.**
//
Once the synchronization completes you'll be good to go.

[[grading]]
== Grading

MP0 is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:

. *20 points*: `farthestNorth`
  ** *10 points* for passing the simple tests
  ** *10 points* for passing the randomized tests
. *20 points*: `beenHere`
  ** *10 points* for passing the simple tests
  ** *10 points* for passing the randomized tests
. *20 points*: `nextRandomLocation`
  ** *10 points* for passing the simple tests
  ** *10 points* for passing the randomized tests
. *20 points*: `testCenterButton`: note that passing this test requires
modifying `MainActivity.java`
. *10 points* for no `checkstyle` violations
. *10 points* for submitting code that earns at least 30 points before *Friday
2/1/2019 @ 5PM.*

[[submitting]]
=== Submitting Your Work

Follow the instructions from the
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git#submitting[submitting portion]
//
of the
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git#workflow[CS 125 workflow]
//
instructions.
//
Note that the first time you do this you'll want to pay careful attention to the
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git/#troubleshooting[common submission pitfalls],
//
particularly if your submission doesn't show up when you think it should.

[[testing]]
=== Test Cases

You should carefully review the test cases in `LocatorTest.java`.
//
The MP0 _library_ testing suite tests your code using random inputs and
pre-computed correct outputs.
//
So, for example, when testing `beenHere`, we have pre-computed the correct
answer for a small subset of test cases and use this to determine whether your
solution works in all cases.

In contrast, testing the user-facing parts of Android apps is notoriously
difficult.
//
This semester we'll be using
//
http://robolectric.org/[Robolectric]
//
to write lightweight interface tests.
//
For MP0 all we are testing is that you've hooked up the "Center" button
properly, but in future MPs these tests will become more comprehensive.

Automated testing is a hugely important part of modern software development.
//
Just like computers are good at running programs, they are also good at running
programs to debug other programs.
//
Independently developing a method and the function that tests it allows the two
to support each other.
//
The test may find errors in the method, and, the method may also identify errors
in the test.

For all three library functions we provide you with both _simple_ test cases
using a small number of select inputs *and* exhaustive test cases that use many
randomly-generated inputs.
//
The former should be used during iterative development.
//
For MP0, both are used during grading&mdash;but on future MPs there will be few
to no points for the simpler test suites.
//
The <<autograding, local autograder>> we provide will be able to help you
estimate your score before you submit.

[[autograding]]
=== Autograding

We have provided you with an autograding script that you can use to _estimate_
your current grade as often as you want.
//
Your Android Studio project contains run configuration called "Grade" that will run the
autograder for MP0.
//
You can also run the grader by installing
//
link:/tech/intellijplugin/[our plugin]
//
and then pressing the button that looks like the CS 125 shield.

Unless you have modified the test cases or autograder configuration files, the
autograding output should approximate the score that you will earn when you
submit.
//
If you modify our test cases or the autograding configuration, _all bets are
off_.
//
You may also lose points if your solution runs too slowly and exceeds the
testing timeouts.

[[style]]
=== Style Points

90 points on MP0 are for correctly implementing the required functions.
//
The other 10 points are for _style_.
//
Writing readable code according to a style guideline is extremely important, and
we are going to help you get into this habit right from the start.
//
Every software development company and most active open-source projects maintain
style guidelines.
//
Adhering to them will help others understand and integrate your contributions.

We have configured the `checkstyle` plugin to enforce a variant of the
//
http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/sun_style.html[Sun Java coding style].
//
Android Studio should naturally generate code that meets this standard.
//
So you should not have to fight with IntelliJ too much to avoid `checkstyle`
violations.

However, the `checkstyle` plugin does require you to add
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc]
//
comments, and also avoid the use of so-called
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47882/what-is-a-magic-number-and-why-is-it-bad[_magic
numbers_].
//
You may find these requirements a bit annoying at first, but we trust that you
will get used to them.
//
Once you build good style habits, you won't have to think about it anymore, and
will just go on with your business writing beautiful code.

[[cheating]]
== Cheating

[.lead]
//
Please review the
//
link:/info/2019/spring/syllabus#cheating[CS 125 cheating policies].

All submitted MP source code will be checked by automated plagiarism detection
software.
//
Cheaters will receive stiff penalties&mdash;the hard-working students in the
class that are willing to struggle for their grade demand it.
