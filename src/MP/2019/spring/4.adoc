[.lead]

Recursion is an important and powerful programming technique.
//
Sometimes it is the best way to solve a problem, and sometimes it is almost _the
only_ way to solve a problem.
//
Recursion can be tricky to wrap your head around at first, but as usual the best
way to get comfortable with this technique is to practice.

For MP4 you'll analyze molecules represented as graphs, another recursive data
structure.
//
You will use recursive and iterative functions, and apply recursive problem
solving technique by breaking down a large task into several smaller ones.

*MP4 is due Monday 4/15/2019 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP4 is for submitting code that earns at least
_40 points_ by *Monday 4/8/2019 @ 5PM.*
//
As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
link:/info/2019/spring/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

MP4 gives you plenty of practice with recursive programming.
//
You'll work with existing data structures like you did in link:/MP/2019/spring/3/[MP3],
write member functions like you did in link:/MP/2019/spring/2/[MP2], use collections like
the arrays you used in link:/MP/2019/spring/1/[MP1],
and of course continue to use imperative programming
constructs like in link:/MP/2019/spring/0[MP0].
//
It really does bring together almost everything we've done this semester.

The main task in MP4 is naming simple organic molecules.
//
Writing one function to handle all molecules would be **extremely hard**.
//
Fortunately, the task can be broken down into several smaller tasks that are
_easy_ to implement!
//
Factoring out smaller, repeated pieces of functionality into helper functions is
a critical skill when writing larger, more complex programs.
//
Our test cases are designed to guide you as you build up your solution to handle
more and more kinds of molecules.

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

As usual, MP4 is split into two modules:

* `/lib/`: a library that performs various analyses of the given molecule.
//
* `/app/`: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
//
The Android app is technically functional, but could use one modification from you.
//
And, for it to work correctly, you need to finish the library in `lib`.

Your primary job is to complete the required analyses in
`MoleculeAnalyzer.java`.
//
The molecule to analyze is provided for you in the form of a `BondedAtom`
object.
//
This data structure is recursively defined, so even though one `BondedAtom`
instance only represents a single atom, you can use its instance methods to get
references to other atoms and thereby explore the entire molecule.
//
Every atom also has a `ChemicalElement` object with some information on its
element, along with a variety of helper functions that we encourage you to use.

[.alert.alert-primary]

As always, you will find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/[MP4 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function and class does.

[[getting]]
=== Obtaining MP4

Use
//
https://classroom.github.com/a/sRPUeiXp[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to fork your copy of MP4.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into Android Studio following
//
link:/MP/2019/spring/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
For the points breakdown, see the <<grading, grading description below>>.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP4

Getting 100 points on MP4 doesn't take a ton of code
//
footnote:[But getting _110_ points on MP4 _may_ require a ton of code. The extra
credit _is not easy_.].
//
But some of it is _recursive_ code, so it will take you longer.
//
Don't expect to make as much progress writing recursive code when you are
getting started.
//
It's tricky, and takes practice.
//
Slow down and focus on applying the recursive design principles you've learned
in lecture, lab, and on the homework problems.

=== Understand The Requirements

Just like with previous MPs,
//
https://blog.codinghorror.com/because-reading-is-fundamental-2/[reading is
fundamental]
//
to your success.
//
Understand
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/[the specification],
//
<<lists, how to use lists in Java>>,
//
the <<graphs, connections to graphs>>,
//
and&mdash;particularly if you are attempting the extra credit&mdash;the
//
<<chemistry, chemistry tutorial>>.
//
Read those first.
//
Then read them again.

=== Designing Recursive Functions

Recall the guidelines for designing recursive functions that we presented in lab
and lecture:

. *Every recursive function must have a base case.*
//
If you don't stop recursing, you will eventually run out of memory and your
program will crash.
//
So there must be some case where you do not call yourself again.
//
. *The base case must be reached.*
//
As a corollary to the above, every set of recursive calls must eventually
_reach_ the base case.
//
Otherwise (again) your program will recurse infinitely, run out of memory and
crash.
//
. *The problem should get smaller each time.*
//
Each recursive step should make progress somehow.
//
This can happen in several ways.
//
In Fibonacci, for example, we reduce the size of the problem by reduction toward
known starting values.
//
When processing trees, we reduce the size of the problem by splitting the tree
into several subtrees which are considered separately.
//
How this happens depends on the problem, but it does need to happen somehow.

It can also be helpful to consider simple cases.
//
How do you reverse a list with only one element?
//
Now, extend that to a list with two elements, then three.
//
You may begin to see a pattern emerge that helps you understand how to design
your recursive approach.

[[lists]]
=== Java ``ArrayList``s

[.lead]
//
Your work on MP4 will be aided by the one of the two data structures that you
meet in heaven: lists.

We've built a simple list together in lecture.
//
But for MP4 you'll want to use Java's built-in
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html[``ArrayList``]
class,
//
one implementation of the complete
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/List.html[Java `List`
interface]
//
footnote:[You could also use other implementations, like ``LinkedList``s, but
the performance differences aren't important for this MP.].

As a review, like an array, a list is an ordered collection of values.
//
Unlike an array, a list allows you to add and remove items after it has been
created.
//
You'll make extensive use of these list methods as you complete MP4:

* `add`: adds a new item at the end, extending the list's length by 1
//
* `contains`: returns `true` if the list contains the passed value, and `false`
otherwise
//
* `size`: gets the current length of the list, just like the `length` field of
an array

Other list methods may also come in handy.
//
Review the official
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/List.html[`List` interface
documentation]
//
for the complete list and documentation.

[[help]]
=== Getting Help

The course staff is ready and willing to help you every step of the way!
//
Please come to link:/info/2019/spring/syllabus/#calendar[office hours], or post on the
{forum} when you need help.
//
You should also feel free to help each other, as long as you do not violate the
<<cheating, academic integrity requirements>>.

[[graphs]]
== Graphs

[.lead]
//
At first glance this MP may _seem_ to be about <<chemistry, chemistry>>.
//
But it's not.
//
It's really about *graphs* and various recursive operations on graphs.

A
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)[graph]
//
is a very general and extremely powerful data structure.
//
It consists of a series of nodes connected by edges.
//
Graphs can be either
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph[_directed_]
//
footnote:[edges have a direction, meaning that a connection from node A to node
B does not imply a connection from node B to node A]
//
or
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)[_undirected_]
//
footnote:[edges do not have a direction, meaning that a connection from node A
to node B implies a connection from node B to node A].
//
We can also associate properties with either the nodes or the edges of the
graph.

=== Examples of Graphs

In this MP you'll be working with undirected graphs where the nodes are atoms
and the edges are bonds between the atoms. Both have properties in this case:
the type of atom for the nodes, and the strength of bond (single vs. double)
for the edges.
//
But graphs are so ubiquitous and so powerful in computer science because of the
sheer number of different things in the real world that can be represented as
graphs:

* **Social networks are graphs**, with the nodes being people and the edges
friendship relationships between them.
//
Depending on the type of social network the graph could be either undirected
(accepting my friend request means that you are my friend and I am also yours)
or directed (following me on Twitter does not imply that I follow you).
//
Given the increasing importance of social networks in spreading information
//
footnote:[and, yes, disinformation],
//
the dynamics and properties of these networks has been a topic of intense
research for years.
//
* **Many kinds of transportation problems can be modeled as graphs**, with the
nodes being locations (intersections, airports) and the edges paths between them
(streets,
//
https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-aircraft-routing-works/8732/[air tracks]).
//
Here the edges probably have properties like distance or the amount of fuel
required, and we become interested in properties of the graph like the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem[shortest path] between two
points, where shortest could have multiple meanings (shortest in space, fastest,
cheapest).
//
* **The internet is a graph**, with the nodes being computers connected to the
internet and the edges paths between them, both wired and wireless.
//
Just like on transportation graphs, routing on the internet involves trying to
determine the best path between two communicating machines.

=== Graph Operations for MP4

To simplify MP4, we've provided you with helper functions that perform the
chemistry-specific naming tasks.
//
But to get them to work, you need to complete a series of recursive functions
that operate on graphs.

**MP4 is set up specifically so that there is a strong mapping between the
functions you need to complete and common operations on graphs.**
//
So, for example, while your `getRing` function locates a ring in the molecule
(if one exists) because it affects the molecule's name,
//
this is a common graph operation:
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_(graph_theory)[_cycle detection_].

Here are some of the `MoleculeAnalyzer` helper functions you need to complete to
get full credit on MP4
//
footnote:[_not_ including extra credit, that requires more work]
//
and their analogous graph operations:

. https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2019/mp4/lib/MoleculeAnalyzer.html#findAllAtoms-edu.illinois.cs.cs125.spring2019.mp4.lib.BondedAtom-java.util.ArrayList-[`findAllAtoms`]:

In addition, many of the other helper functions you need to compete use the
results of these operations.
//
In particular,
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2019/mp4/lib/MoleculeAnalyzer.html#getMolecularWeight--[`getMolecularWeight`],

//
and
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2019/mp4/lib/MoleculeAnalyzer.html#getTips--[`getTips`]
//
are fairly simple once you have established a list of all of the atoms in the
molecule using
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP4-Solution/edu/illinois/cs/cs125/spring2019/mp4/lib/MoleculeAnalyzer.html#findAllAtoms-edu.illinois.cs.cs125.spring2019.mp4.lib.BondedAtom-java.util.ArrayList-[`findAllAtoms]`.

[[findallatoms]]
=== Recursion on Graphs

Recursion on graphs isn't fundamentally different from recursion on trees.
//
But there are some additional considerations to keep in mind.

Let's consider `findAllAtoms`.
//
As usual, we want to identify (1) the base case, (2) the recursive step, (3) and
how we are going to combine results.
//
Imagine we're finding all nodes on this simple graph:

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/6n-graf.svg/333px-6n-graf.svg.png[role='img-fluid']

==== `findAllAtoms`: base case

On a tree we would start at the root and work our way down, but a graph doesn't
have that same notion of top and bottom.
//
Your `findAllAtoms` function needs to be able to begin at _any_ atom in the
graph and locate all others
//
footnote:[Note that you can assume that all atoms in the graph are reachable
from any starting point.
//
This is referred to as a
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_(graph_theory)[_connected graph_].].
//
So instead of our base case being a leaf node, we'll define the base case as
reaching a node that we have _already visited_.
//
At that point we know that some other call to our recursive function is already
exploring the graph from that point and we can stop.

==== `findAllAtoms`: recursive step

On a tree we make the problem smaller by restarting our algorithm on each
subtree.
//
A graph is similar, except that we restart our algorithm on each _neighbor_.
//
Like a tree, each part of the graph that begins at each of any node's neighbors
is, itself, a graph.

Note that in general this will mean that after arriving at Node 2 from Node 1 in
the example above we will recursively return to Node 1.
//
But this is fine since our base case above should realize that Node 1 has
already been visited and stop at that point.
//
This is how we ensure that the problem gets smaller at each step.

We could explicitly avoid backtracking during our recursive step by not
returning to the node that we visited previously.
//
But having the base case do this check also allows us to avoid _cycles_, which
might cause us to return to a node that we have already visited but is _not_ the
node we came from.
//
This is one critical difference between trees and graphs.
//
In a tree if you start at the root and only work downward by recursing into
subtrees, your recursion will _always terminate_.
//
On a graph if you start at any node and continue blindly following all
neighbors, your recursion will continue infinitely if the node contains a
_cycle_ or loop.
//
The example above contains two cycles: 4 &harr; 5 &harr; 2 &harr; 3 &harr; 4 and
5 &harr; 2 &harr; 1 &harr; 5.

Given that visiting all neighbors is a common operation on graphs, we've helped
you out by making the `BondedAtom` class iterable.
//
So, given a `BondedAtom` `current`, you can visit all of its neighbors as
follows:

[source,java]
----
for (BondedAtom neighbor : current) {
  // Do something with neighbor
}
----

==== `findAllAtoms`: combining results

Our final task is to figure out how to combine results together.
//
Conceptually, starting with Node 1 in the example above, recursing to Node 2
will find some group of nodes while recursing to Node 5 will find another group
of nodes.
//
Then I combine them, add myself, and I'm done.
//
But how do we get this to work _in practice_?

Here's the first place where our lists are going to come in handy.
//
`findAllAtoms` is already supposed to return a list of the atoms in the
molecule.
//
So to combine my results I just let all of my recursive calls modify the same
list, and when they complete it will contain all of the atoms in the molecule.
//
I can also use this list during each recursive step to check to make sure that I
don't backtrack and avoid cycles.
//
Note that this means that I need to pass a reference to the list to each step of
my recursive algorithm.

==== `findAllAtoms`: putting it all together

To help you get started with `findAllAtoms`, here is a solution sketch based on
the solution set.

[source,python]
----
def findAllAtoms(current, atoms):
    """ if current is in atoms, we've already been here, so stop """
    """ add current to atoms """
    """ restart findAllAtoms on all current's neighbors """
----

Like many recursive functions, `findAllAtoms` is fairly beautiful and terse once
you have completed it correctly.
//
If it begins to get long and ugly, you are probably doing something wrong.
//
Ask for help!

[[findpath]]
==== Generalizing `findAllAtoms`

`findAllAtoms` is a good starting point but simpler than the other recursive
functions that you'll need to complete the MP.
//
One way in which it's simpler is that it only maintains _one_ list.
//
In contrast, when looking for cycles or a path between two nodes you'll need to
create a new list each time you restart your recursive function, since each
neighbor establishes a new path.
//
You'll also need to adjust the return value of your recursive function based on
what each neighbor finds.

For example, here is a solution sketch for `findPath` again based on the
solution set:

[source,python]
----
def findPath(current, end, path):
    """ add ourselves to the path """
    """ if current equals end we're found a path, so return it """
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        """ avoid backtracking and cycles """
        """ make a copy of the path """
        """ restart findPath from the neighbor using the copied path """
        """ if a path exists from the neighbor, return it, otherwise continue """

    """ if the loop terminates then there was no path from any of my neighbors """
    """ if no path exists from any of my neighbors then no path exists from me """
----

Note that this algorithm only works on a graph _without_ cycles, since once you
have cycles there are multiple paths between any two nodes in the graph.
//
Once you have `findPath` working you can use it is the basis for your cycle
detection algorithm, which is quite similar.

[[chemistry]]
== Chemistry Tutorial

[.lead]
//
Programming is a powerful skill for many reasons, one of which is that it can be
applied to virtually any science.
//
Bioinformatics&mdash;the processing of biological data, especially genetic
sequences&mdash;was critical to the Human Genome Project, for example.

In this MP, you'll be applying your programming skills to chemistry.
//
Nevertheless, we don't require or expect you to have a deep background in
chemistry, so this section tells you exactly what you need to know to complete
the assignment
//
footnote:[We're therefore skipping over a lot of interesting stuff. You can
learn all the cool details by taking a chemistry class!].

=== Basics

Molecules are composed of multiple atoms.
//
Atoms are joined by at least one bond to other atoms in the same molecule.
//
Hydrogen gas, for example, consists of two hydrogen atoms bonded to each other.
//
In larger molecules, each atom can have multiple bonds, but each bond always
connects exactly two atoms.

The number of bonds an atom makes depends on what _element_ it is.
//
We call the number of bonds an element wants its
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_(chemistry)[_valence_].
//
Oxygen wants two bonds, for example.
//
Depending on the number of electrons shared, multiple bonds can connect a pair of atoms.
Double bonds are still represented by just one edge in our graphs.
//
The oxygen molecules you breathe each consist of two oxygen atoms connected to
each other by a double bond, so each atom is involved in exactly the number of bonds
it wants to be.
//
If an atom has more or fewer bonds than is appropriate for its valence it is
considered _charged_.

Different elements have different weights&mdash;for example, a carbon atom is
heavier than a hydrogen atom.
//
All atoms of a given element have roughly
//
footnote:[not exactly due to
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope[_isotopes_]
//
]
//
the same weight.
//
You can determine the _molecular weight_ of a molecule simply by adding up all
the weights of the atoms in it.

Each element has a one- or two-letter symbol that is used to denote it in
drawings and formulas.
//
You may recognize these from the https://www.ptable.com/[periodic table].
For example, "O" is the symbol for oxygen.
//
This MP uses only seven elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, helium,
fluorine, chlorine, and bromine.
//
Those last three are all _halogens_&mdash;we'll come back to that.

We're focusing on _organic_ molecules for this MP.
//
All organic molecules involve carbon, generally arranged in chains with a bunch
of hydrogens and sometimes a few other atoms connected to them.
//
The simplest organic molecule is methane, one carbon atom with four hydrogen
atoms connected to it by one single bond each:

----
  H
  |
H-C-H
  |
  H
----

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testMolecularWeight` and `testHasCharged` you need to first complete
<<findallatoms, `findAllAtoms`>>.
//
Once you have a list of atoms you can sum their weight or return whether any
atom is charged.
//
--

[[chemicaldrawing]]
=== Drawing

The app code we've given you handles the drawing of molecules, but the rest of
this section has illustrations of the kind of molecules we'll ask your code to
name.
//
So you should know how to interpret these drawings.

Since organic molecules often contain a lot of hydrogen atoms and quite a few
carbons, always identifying those atoms as "H" and "C" in drawings is a pain.
//
So organic chemists use
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_formula[skeletal formulas]
//
to keep things tidy.
//
Skeletal formulas never explicitly show carbon&mdash;it's assumed that the unlabeled
tips, kinks, and intersections of lines are carbon atoms.
//
Likewise, hydrogens
attached to carbon atoms are not shown&mdash;it's assumed that every carbon has the
right number of hydrogens on it to fill its valence.

So this (carbons circled in red)...

image::Propane.png[role='img-fluid']

...is the same molecule as this...

----
  H H H
  | | |
H-C-C-C-H
  | | |
  H H H
----

Elements other than carbon and hydrogen are known as _heteroatoms_ and are shown
on drawings by their symbol.
//
Hydrogens bonded directly to heteroatoms are explicitly shown on the diagram,
like this:

image::HeteroatomExample.png[role='img-fluid']

----
      H
      |
  H H O H
  | | | |
F-C-C-C-C-H

  H H H H
----

=== Intro to Naming

When talking out loud or writing in plain text, it's not possible to draw a
structure.
//
Instead, the molecule under discussion must be named.
//
Of course, the name needs to be descriptive enough that the molecule can be
unambiguously identified.
//
Ideally each molecule would only have one standard name.

Naming things in computer science is also a challenge.
//
There is a famous saying that there are only
//
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html[two hard problems in computer
science]:
//
cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.

The
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry[
International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]
//
(IUPAC) decided the standard rules for chemical names.
//
Since so many molecules are possible, the rules are quite extensive.
//
We present a version of the standard that is simplified but correct for naming
the molecules checked by the test cases.

Since carbon is the backbone of organic molecules, the number of carbons in the
molecule sets the backbone for its name.
//
Every chain length has a name.
//
The names of simple carbon-or-hydrogen-only molecules always end in "ane."
//
"Meth" is the name for a one-carbon chain, hence "methane" for the one-carbon
molecule discussed above.
//
The name for a two-carbon chain is "eth," so the molecule with two carbons fully
saturated with hydrogens is "ethane."
//
The chain base names from 1 to 10 are given in the starter code.

This is hexane, which has six carbons:

image::Hexane.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingSimpleStraight`, your `getLinearBackbone` implementation only
needs to identify the longest chain of carbons in the molecule.
//
`getBackbones` is responsible for finding all backbone candidates, by
using `getTips` to find all tip carbons and then `findPath` on each pair of tips.
//
Then `getLinearBackBone` can select the longest.
//
Each `BondedAtom` instance has an `isCarbon` method that you may find useful.
//
--

=== Naming Rings

Chains of three atoms or more can form a cycle of bonds.
//
A cycle of a given length is clearly not the same molecule as the straight chain
of the same length, so our naming strategy needs to differentiate them.
//
This is done by adding "cyclo" before the chain base name.
//
The linear three-carbon chain molecule is "propane," so the
three-carbon cyclic molecule is "cyclopropane."

This is cyclopentane, which has five carbons arranged in a ring:

//
To pass `testNamingSimpleCyclic`, you need to complete `getRing` to return
the list of carbon atoms in the ring, if present.
//
--

=== Naming Simple Substituents

Useful molecules are usually more complex than just a chain or ring of carbons.
//
Most organic molecules have other atoms or groups attached to the carbon
backbone.
//
For example, this is propane with a bromine bonded to the central carbon:

image::2BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Things that are hanging off of the backbone are called _substituents_.
//
To fully describe a molecule, we need to indicate not only how many carbons it
has, but also which substituents it has.

Substituent names usually go before the chain base name.
//
The name for a bromine substituent is "bromo."
//
So we might name the previous molecule "bromopropane," but then what would we
name this molecule?

image::1BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

That's also propane with a bromine attached, but in a different place!
//
We need a way to say where the substituent is attached to the backbone.
//
To do this, we number the carbons starting at 1 and increasing along the backbone:

image::NumberedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

We can then name a bromine substituent on carbon 2 "2-bromo" and a bromine
substituent on carbon 1 "1-bromo."
//
Putting the name fragments together, we name the former molecule
"2-bromopropane" and the latter "1-bromopropane."
//
What about this one?

image::3BromoPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Numbering carbons from left to right, we would call this 3-bromopropane.
//
But you can rotate the molecule in 3D space and find that it's actually the same
//
as 1-bromopropane.
//
IUPAC rules **prefer the name with the lowest position**, so "1-bromopropane" is
correct and "3-bromopropane" is not.

This is actually easier to deal with on a ring, since we can always number the
ring carbons such that one substituent gets position 1.
//
So this is 1-bromocyclopentane
//
footnote:[Or just bromocyclopentane, since IUPAC and the test suite allow
dropping the "1" from the name when there's only one substituent on the ring.
//
Always including the position is easier to implement, but you may do either.]:

image::BromoCyclopentane.png[role='img-fluid']

As is this:

image::RotatedBromoCyclopentane.png[role='img-fluid']

Substituent names for other halogens are similar.
//
Fluorine is "fluoro," chlorine is "chloro."

It's possible for the carbon chain to branch, and when that happens we get
carbon (_alkyl_) substituents.
//
These are named similarly to straight chains, but suffixed with "yl" instead of
"ane."
//
A single-carbon ("meth") branch is called a "methyl" substituent, so this is
2-methylpropane:

image::Isobutane.png[role='img-fluid']

Since the base name for a two-carbon chain is "eth," one might name this "2-ethylpropane"
because it has a three-carbon backbone with a two-carbon branch:

image::Confusing2MethylButane.png[role='img-fluid']

But if we rotate things a bit, it becomes a four-carbon backbone with a one-carbon branch
(2-methylbutane):

image::2MethylButane.png[role='img-fluid']

IUPAC rules **prefer the longer backbone**, so "2-methylbutane" is correct.
//
"2-ethylpropane" is incorrect (because it has a shorter backbone), as is
"3-methylbutane" (because it has a higher substituent position).

Again, this is actually easier on rings, since we're always going to consider
the cycle the backbone.
//
This molecule has a cycle of three carbons ("cyclopropane") with a three-carbon
branch substituent ("propyl"), so we name it "1-propylcyclopropane":

image::PropylCyclopropane.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingOneSubstituentCyclic`, you need to find any ring present
(using `getRing`) and then rotate it properly (using `rotateRing`) so that any
substituent is located at position 1 on the ring (index 0 of the list).

To pass `testNamingOneSubstituentLinear`, you need to refine `getLinearBackbone`
to select the longest backbone that places the substituent in the
lowest-numbered position.
//
Note that you should consider backbones running in _either_ direction.
//
--

**You now know all the naming rules you need to get 100 points on MP4!**
//
There are a couple other details of these last couple test cases handled by our starter code,
//
so if you're curious about those&mdash;or attempting the extra credit&mdash;read on.

=== High-Priority Substituents

All the substituents discussed above are named before the backbone in the final,
overall name.
//
They are considered _low-priority_ substituents.
//
There are also high-priority substituents whose presence affects the suffix of
the overall name.
//
These include _alcohols_, _ketones_, _aldehydes_, and _carboxylic acids_.

An alcohol substituent is an OH (oxygen and hydrogen) group attached to the
backbone by a single bond, like in this molecule
//
footnote:[with which most of you should have no experience]:
//

----
  H H
  | |
H-C-C-O-H
  | |
  H H
----

This is the skeletal drawing of the same molecule:

image::Ethanol.png[role='img-fluid']

It has two carbons, so the backbone name is "eth."
//
The substituent can be at position 1 if we number from right to left.
//
Alcohol substituents change the suffix of the name from "ane" to "anol," with
the substituent position inserted before the "ol."
//
So we would name that molecule ethan-1-ol
//
footnote:[Or just ethanol, since it's unambiguous&mdash;ethan-2-ol is the same
molecule.].

Likewise, this molecule has a five-carbon backbone ("pent")
and an alcohol substituent at position 2, so we name it pentan-2-ol:

image::Pentan2ol.png[role='img-fluid']

Ketone substituents are oxygen atoms double-bonded to the backbone.
//
They change the suffix to "anone," again with the position before the "one."
//
This molecule removes fingernail polish:

image::Acetone.png[role='img-fluid']

It has a three-carbon backbone ("prop") and a ketone substituent at position 2,
so its systematic name is propan-2-one.

Alcohols and ketones can both appear on rings too.
//
This is cyclobutan-1-ol (cyclic four-carbon backbone with an alcohol
substituent):

image::Cyclobutanol.png[role='img-fluid']

And this is cyclooctan-1-one (cyclic eight-carbon backbone with a ketone substituent):

image::Cyclooctanone.png[role='img-fluid']

The other two kinds of high-priority substituents we consider can only appear at
the tip of a linear molecule.
//
We'll refer to them collectively as _end groups_.
//
Since they can only occur on tips, they are always assigned position 1, so that
does not need to be made explicit in the name.
//
Aldehydes are essentially ketones that happen to be at a tip
//
footnote:[They're named differently because they have somewhat different
chemical reactivity. Collectively, they're referred to as _carbonyls_.].
//
They are named similarly to alcohols, but with "al" instead of "ol" on the end.
//
This molecule has a two-carbon backbone ("eth") and an aldehyde tip ("al"), so
we name it ethanal:

image::Ethanal.png[role='img-fluid']

Carboxylic acids are essentially a combination of an aldehyde and an alcohol on
one tip carbon.
//
They replace the "ane" suffix with "anoic acid."
//
So the three-carbon carboxylic acid is named "propanoic acid":

image::PropanoicAcid.png[role='img-fluid']

=== Multiple Substituents

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
**Challenge problem!**
//
You can earn _5 points_ of extra credit for handling this case.
//
--

A lot of useful molecules have multiple substituents, not just one.
//
To fully describe these, we need to include information about each substituent
in the name.
//
To do that, we name each substituent by itself, then put all the name fragments
together.
//
Consider this three-carbon molecule:

image::DihalogenatedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

To minimize the position number of the first substituent encountered, we number
from left to right.
//
We then have a bromine at position 1 ("1-bromo") and a chlorine at position 2
("2-chloro").
//
The carbon backbone's name is "propane," so we put it all together, separate
substituent fragments with an extra dash, and get 1-bromo-2-chloropropane.

Now let's swap the halogens:

image::SwappedDihalogenatedPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

The molecule is still numbered from left to right, so one might name it
1-chloro-2-bromopropane.
//
But the correct name is 2-bromo-1-chloropropane&mdash;IUPAC rules **order
substituents alphabetically by name, not numerically by position**.

Now let's make both the halogens chlorine:

image::DichloroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

When there are multiple substituents with the same name (but not necessarily
position), we combine them into one name fragment by putting all the positions
into one sorted comma-separated list and adding a multiplicity prefix indicating
the number of copies of the substituent.
//
Since this molecule has chlorine at positions 1 and 2, the position list is
"1,2".
//
Since there are two instances of the chlorine substituent, we prefix the
"chloro" with "di."
//
(Three is "tri" and so on; the starter code contains an array with all the
multiplicity names.)
//
The full name for this molecule is 1,2-dichloropropane.

It's possible to have multiple substituents at the same position:

image::FluoroMethylPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

That's 2-fluoro-2-methylpropane because the (top) fluorine substituent and the
(bottom) methyl substituent are both on position 2 of the (horizontal) backbone.
//
The "fluoro" part is first because F sorts before M.

If the same substituent occurs multiple times on the same carbon, the position
number appears multiple times in the list.
//
So this is 1,1-difluoropropane:

image::DifluoroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

There can also be multiple high-priority substituents.
//
Just like with low-priority ones, all the positions at which the substituent
occurs go into the comma-separated list and the multiplicity prefix is added to
the substituent name.
//
Consider this four-carbon chain with two alcohols:

image::ButaneDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

Alcohol substituents occur at positions 2 and 3, and there are two of them, so
the name will end in "-2,3-diol."
//
Since the fragment after the last dash begins with a consonant, however, the "e"
in "ane" is retained (to make the name easier to pronounce).
//
So the name is
butan**e**-2,3-diol, not butan-2,3-diol.

The prefixes for high multiplicities, like "tetra" for four, tend to end with "a."
When the last fragment starts with "o," the multiplicity's "a" is cut off to make the name easier
to pronounce. So this is propane-1,1,3,3-tetrol, not propane-1,1,3,3-tetr**a**ol:

image::PropaneTetrol.png[role='img-fluid']

[.alert.alert-success]
//
--
//
To pass `testNamingMultipleSubstituents`, you need to find the best backbone
(whether linear or cyclic), numbered in a way that minimizes the position of the
_first_ substituent encountered.
//
You may need to refine your `getLinearBackbone` helper function.

The molecules you're asked to name here have _either_ low-priority or
high-priority substituents, not a mix of both.
//

=== Priority Tiebreaks

[.alert.alert-primary]
--
**Challenge problem!** You can earn _5 points_ of extra credit (on top of the previous 5)
for handling this case.
--

Up to this point, it's been fairly easy to choose the correct numbering
direction once the backbone is established&mdash;either the molecule was
symmetric or one direction encounters a substituent before the other.
//
All substituents in each tested molecule had the same priority.
//
Now it's time for the idea of priority to actually make a difference.
//
How do we number this molecule?

image::MixedPriorityButane.png[role='img-fluid']

If we go from left to right, the bromine gets position 1 and the ketone gets
position 3.
//
That sounds good.
//
But the ketone is a high-priority substituent, so its position is more important
to minimize.
//
The correct numbering direction is from right to left, so the name is
4-bromobutan-2-one ("but" from the four-carbon backbone, "2-one" from the ketone
at position 2, and "4-bromo" from the bromine at position 4).

Likewise, if there are any high-priority substituents on a ring, one should
occupy position 1:

image::MethylCyclobutanone.png[role='img-fluid']

That molecule is named 3-methylcyclobutan-1-one because numbering starts at the
rightmost carbon.

High-priority substituents also affect the selection of the backbone in
non-cyclic molecules.
//
Previously this molecule would be expected to have a five-carbon backbone:

image::ForkedDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

But (our simplified version of) IUPAC rules say that **all high-priority
substituents must be attached directly to the backbone**.
//
So that molecule's backbone is the three carbons between the alcohol
substituents, and the three-carbon chain going off to the left is a propyl
substituent.
//
This molecule's name is 2-propylpropane-1,3-diol.

To break ties between possible backbones of the same length after ensuring that
all high-priority substituents are included, compare the total number of
substituents:

image::SubCountTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

The four-way branch carbon and the three carbons to its left are definitely
included in the backbone because the alcohol is attached over there.
//
If the backbone continued to the right, the methyl and the fork below would each
be substituents.
//
But if the backbone continued down, the methyl above, ethyl to the right, and
methyl off the three-way branch are each a substituent.
//
That way produces more substituents and is the correct backbone.
//
It is numbered from left to right because that direction encounters an alcohol
at position 2, while the other way only encounters a methyl at position 2.

image::NumberedSubCountTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

Above is the correctly numbered backbone. The full name is
4-ethyl-4,5-dimethylhexan-2-ol.

Notice how the previous example used position 2 as the direction tiebreak
because both directions had no substituents on backbone carbon 1.
//
Comparisons continue until the tie is broken.
//
Consider this nearly symmetric molecule:

image::BromoButaneTriol.png[role='img-fluid']

Either direction has a high-priority substituent at position 1.
//
Right-to-left has a high-priority substituent at position 2, but left-to-right
has only a low-priority substituent there. So right-to-left wins, and the
correct name is 3-bromobutane-1,2,4-triol.

The presence of multiple substituents on the same carbon can also serve as a
tiebreak:

image::TrifluoroPropane.png[role='img-fluid']

Numbering left to right produces one fluorine at position 1, while going right
to left produces two at position 1.
//
So right-to-left wins, and the correct name is 1,1,3-trifluoropropane.
//
**One high-priority substituent beats any number of low-priority ones**, so if the
leftmost fluorine was replaced with an alcohol, the numbering would go left to
right.

If the count of substituents of both priorities is the same at every backbone
carbon, the final tiebreak is the name of the substituent&mdash;alphabetically
first wins.

image::AlphabetTiebreak.png[role='img-fluid']

Both directions have a high-priority substituent at positions 1 and 5 and
low-priority substituents at positions 2, 3, and 4.
//
The substituents are exactly the same at position 1, so tiebreak proceeds to
position 2.
//
Left-to-right has "chloro" where right-to-left has "fluoro."
//
"Chloro" is first alphabetically, so left-to-right wins: the name is
1,5-dibromo-2-chloro-4-fluoro-3-methylpentane-1,5-diol.

All these rules are the same for cyclic molecules.
//
This molecule should be numbered starting at the rightmost carbon and going
clockwise:

image::BromoCyclobutaneDiol.png[role='img-fluid']

That way, it has high-priority substituents at positions 1 and 2, plus a
low-priority one at position 3.
//
Starting at the bromine would put a low-priority substituent at position 1
instead.
//
Starting anywhere else would visit the top (substituent-less) carbon before
getting to all the substituted ones.

On rings, the alphabetic tiebreak affects the starting point in addition to the
numbering:

image::TrihalogenatedCyclopropane.png[role='img-fluid']

All six possible numberings have one low-priority substituent at each of the
three positions.
//
The best one puts the alphabetically first substituent in position 1 and the
alphabetically next one in position 2.
//
The correct numbering starts at the bromine and goes counterclockwise, naming
the molecule 1-bromo-2-chloro-3-fluorocyclopropane.

In summary, our rules break backbone and direction ties in this order:

. Has all high-priority substituents directly attached
//
. Longest carbon chain
//
. Highest number of total substituents
//
. Highest number of high-priority substituents at each position (from 1 until
tiebreak)
//
. Highest number of any substituents at each position (from 1 until tiebreak)
//
. Alphabetically by substituent name (from 1 until tiebreak, remember that each
position can have multiple substituents!)

A good strategy is to generate a list of candidate backbones/numberings
and filter that down by comparing two at a time.
