[.lead]
//
As we have learned previously, computers are frequently used to transform and
analyze data.
//
And an increasing amount of that data is _multi-dimensional_: including both
photo and video data.
//
People are taking a
//
https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/how-many-photographs-of-you-are-out-there-in-the-world/413389/[huge
amount of photos and video],
//
and processing that data is almost entirely done on or by computers.

For MP4 you'll be working with two-dimensional photo pixel data as you complete
the image transformations for a simple Android photo editing app.
//
MP4 is the first of two Android assignments to prepare you for your final
project.
//
But our focus is still on data transformation and strengthening your existing
programming abilities.

*MP4 is due Monday 10/29/2018 @ 5PM.
//
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.*
//
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP4 is for submitting code that earns at least
_50 points_ by *Monday 10/22/2018 @ 5PM.*

As usual, late submissions will be subject to the
//
link:/info/2018/fall/syllabus/#regrading[MP late submission policy].

[[objectives]]
== Learning Objectives

The purpose of MP4 is to introduce you to data transformation and
Android development.
//
You'll begin to learn how to:

. implement various image transformations by performing transformations on 2D
arrays
//
. avoid writing repetitive code by identifying similarities between various
transformations
//
. work with existing object classes

We'll also introduce you to the structure of a simple Android app, and you'll
get practice modifying its UI to reflect the results of your image
transformations.

We'll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(link:/MP/2018/fall/0/[0], link:/MP/2018/fall/1/[1], link:/MP/2018/fall/2/[2], and link:/MP/2018/fall/3/[3]).

[[structure]]
== Assignment Structure

Unlike previous MPs, MP4 is split into two pieces:

* `/lib/`: a library that performs various image transformations.
//
*This library is the only part of the MP tested by the test suite.*
//
* `/app/`: an Android app for you to use for your own interactive testing.
//
The Android app is _almost_ complete, but needs a few modifications from you.
//
And, to work correctly, you need to finish the library in `lib`.

Your primary job is to complete the required transformations in `Transform.java`.
//
These make use of a pixel class defined in `RGBAPixel.java`.
//
These functions are called by the app and, once you complete them, your app will
be almost completely functional&mdash;and we'll be happy to help you with the
rest.

As always, you may find our official
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Fall-2018-MP4-Starter/[MP4 online documentation]
//
helpful in understanding what each function and class is supposed to do.

*Note that we are using Android Studio for MP4.*
//
If you haven't set it up yet,
//
link:/MP/2018/fall/setup/android-studio[start here] and return when you're done.

Once you have Android Studio installed, use
//
https://classroom.github.com/a/CewU5LCF[this GitHub Classroom invitation link]
//
to fork your copy of MP4.
//
Once your repository has been created, import it into *Android Studio* following
//
link:/MP/2018/fall/setup/git/#workflow[our assignment Git workflow guide].
//
The screencast above provides an overview of this process _after_ you have
Android Studio correctly installed.

[[requirements]]
=== Your Goal

At this point you should be familiar with the requirements from previous MPs.
//
See the <<grading, grading description below>>.

[[approach]]
== Approaching MP4

All of our previous advice about how to approach the CS 125 MPs still applies.
//
But MP4 has some unique features that are designed to continue your development
as computer scientists and software developers.

[[packages]]
=== Package Declarations

Because MP4 is an Android app it requires a new code organization concept that
we haven't discussed in lecture yet: Java packages.
//
Happily, this is not at all complicated.
//
Simply duplicate the `package edu.illinois.cs.cs125.mp4.lib` line from
`RGBAPixel.java` in `Transform.java` once you create that file and everything
will work properly.
//
We'll discuss this more soon.

[[dry]]
=== Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

[.lead]
//
Whenever you write software, you should try to adhere to the DRY principle:
_don't repeat yourself_.

What does this mean?
//
It means that you should try to avoid writing duplicative code&mdash;multiple
functions (or parts of the same function) that perform identical tasks.

Consider the fact that any computer program _could_ be written as one giant
function and with no subroutines at all
//
footnote:[Don't try this at home.].
//
But the result would be awful, since any time the program needed to repeat a
task it would have to repeat the code needed to accomplish that task.
//
And any time you fixed a bug in one part of the code, you'd have to find every
other identical part and fix the bug there as well.
//
Code like this quickly becomes impossible to understand, test, debug, and
improve&mdash;and will also make it hard to keep a job.

At first glance, MP4 may seem daunting.
//
You have _12_ functions to write!
//
And yes, you can complete MP4 by writing 12 separate independent functions.

But there is a much smarter way to approach MP4.
//
As a hint, the solution set consists of only _4_ real functions&mdash;with the
rest just calling into this much smaller set of _helper functions_.
//
The reason is that many of the transformations perform similar operations.
//
For example, a shift down is similar to a shift up, as well as a shift left and
a shift right.
//
So rather than writing four separate extremely-similar functions, I can write a
slightly more complicate generic shift function and have it called by all of the
others.

There is a balance here that requires practice to get right.
//
Trying to reduce the needs of 12 different functions to one single method
produces overly-complicate and brittle code.
//
But writing them all separately misses opportunities to harness common
subroutines.
//
You'll get better at this with practice, and MP4 is a good chance to get some.
//
So *do not* implement 12 separate transformation functions, but also *do not*
attempt to implement one function that does everything.
//
There are some natural groupings that you will probably be able to identify.

[[coordinates]]
=== Understand Your Coordinate System

If you are used to working with the coordinate plane in mathematics, the canvas
coordinate system can take some getting used to.
//
In particular:

. `(0, 0)` is at the _top left_, not the bottom left.
//
. Increasing Y values move the image _down_, not up&mdash;keep this in mind when
implementing `shiftUp` and `shiftDown`.
//
. Increasing X values move the image to the right, which matches the
mathematical coordinate system.

Another important pitfall is that the that way that two-dimensional arrays in
Java are initialized _does not_ match up with this coordinate system.
//
So, for example, this static array:

[source,java]
----
int[][] myArray = {
  { 1, 2 },
  { 3, 4 }
};
----

corresponds to _this_ image array:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | `3`

| `2` | `4`

|===

We suggest that you _do not_ try to interpret the statically initialized arrays in
the test suite directly.
//
Instead, use the output from `RGBAPixel` helper methods, which is correctly
formatted.

[[centering]]
==== Centering

Understanding the coordinate system is also important when centering the image
around `(0, 0)`, which you need to do to implement the rotate, flip, and resize
transformations.
//
This is probably one of the trickier parts of MP4, so think it through
carefully.

It is helpful to work some simple examples.
//
For example, consider vertically flipping a 2x2 array.
//
In our coordinate system, the coordinate values of the pixels in the array would
be:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(0, 0)` | `(1, 0)`

| `(0, 1)` | `(1, 1)`

|===

*Note that these are the coordinate values, not the pixel contents*.
//
In order to flip the array properly, we need to adjust the coordinate values as
follows:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `(-0.5, -0.5)` | `(0.5, -0.5)`

| `(-0.5, 0.5)` | `(0.5, 0.5)`

|===

At this point I can swap either the X or Y values and achieve either a
horizontal or vertical flip around the origin.
//
There is only one problem&mdash;Java can't use `double` types as array indices.
//
So we need to do this transformation on a pixel-by-pixel basis.
//
Roughly, here is the approach.
//
For each pixel in the original image:

. Center the pixel
//
. Determine how to transform it to a new location in the transformed image
//
. Undo the centering transformation
//
. Move data from the original image to the transformed image

Once you have a centering procedure that works, you can use it for the
rotations, flips, expands, and shrinks.
//
But this is one of the tougher parts of the assignment, so you might want to
start with the parts that don't require centering: position shifts, color
shifts, green screen and the mystery function.

==== Shrinking and expanding

As a final note about coordinates, please consider carefully how to implement
the shrink and expand transformations.
//
Specifically, if I start with this 2x6 array (with pixel values shown):

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

| `0` | `0` | `1` | `1` | `0` | `0`

|===

and expand it horizontally by a factor of 3, this is the correct result:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

| `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1` | `1`

|===

But it is easy to get this instead:

[.table-bordered]
|===

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

| `1` | *`0`* | `1` | `1` | *`0`* | `1`

|===

You will want to think about this carefully.
//
As a hint, instead of starting with the original array and trying to figure out
where each pixel _goes_ in the transformed array, you may want to start with the
transformed array and calculate where each pixel should _come from_.
//
Also keep in mind that simply casting a double to an integer _does not round the
value properly_.
//
So `(int) doubleValue != Math.round(doubleValue)`.

*Finally, note that shrinking is not tested by the test suite.*
//
You can feel free to implement it to get your web interface to work like the
solution, but it will not affect your score.

==== Testing diff helper

You will notice that the `RGBAPixel` class defines a not very helpful `static`
method to show the difference between two photo arrays.
//
You should feel free to improve this method so that it is more useful during
your debugging.

[[testerrors]]
=== Identifying Test Errors

Because of how we have set up MP4, errors present themselves a bit differently.
//
The screencast above shows you how to identify errors caused by problems with
your code when the test suite runs.

In addition, our original Fall 2018 MP4 distribution configured `checkstyle` to
fail the entire build if `checkstyle` fails.
//
This is not how the grader works and may not be what you want.
//
To change that, correct the `checkstyle` block in `lib/build.gradle` so that it
looks like this:

[source,groovy]
----
checkstyle {
    ignoreFailures = true
    toolVersion "8.12"
    checkstyleTest.enabled = false
    configFile = new File(rootDir, "config/checkstyle.xml")
}

[[android]]
== Android

Android is a Java-based framework for building smartphone apps that run on the
Android platform.
//
By learning how to build Android apps, your programs can have enormous impact.
//
As of a year ago, Google estimated that there were
//
https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/17/2-billion-active-android-devices/[_2
billion_]
//
active Android devices.
//
That's over 25% of people on Earth&mdash;and
//
http://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/[several times more
than iOS].

However, Android is also a huge and complex system.
//
It's easy to feel lost when you are getting started.
//
Our best advice is to just slow down, take a deep breath, and try to understand
a bit of what is going on at a time.
//
We'll try to walk you through a few of the salient bits for MP4 below.
//
Google also maintains a
//
https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2[great set of
tutorials on beginning Android development].

**Note that you will use Android for MP4 and MP5 and for your final project**,
so put in some time to familiarizing yourself with it now.
//
It's simply the best way to build exciting things in Android&mdash;programs that
you can share with your friends and family.

[[logging]]

Like any other computer program, an important part of developing on Android is
generating debugging output.
//
On Android, our familiar `System.out.println`
//
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2220547/why-doesnt-system-out-println-work-in-android[doesn't quite work the same way we're used to].

However, Android has a simple yet powerful _logging_ system.
//
Unlike `System.out.println`, logging systems allow you to specify multiple log
_levels_ indicating the kind of output that you are generating.
//
This allows you to distinguish between, for example, debugging output that might
only be useful during development and a warning message that might indicate a
more serious problem or failure.
//
The Android logger also allows you to attach a `String` _tag_ to each message to
help separate them when you are debugging or developing.
//
So the final syntax of the call to generate a debugging message, for example, is
`Log.d(TAG, message)`.

For more information, watch the screencast above or review
//
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html[Android's official
logging documentation].

The Android
//
https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html[`Activity` class]
//
corresponds to a single screen that the user can interact with.
//
Our simple app contains only one activity, but most apps consist of several:
maybe an activity corresponding to the app's main screen, another for a
settings dialog, and still others for other parts of the app.

As you might expect, there are two important moments for an activity: when it
appears on the screen, and when it leaves the screen.
//
Android provides functions that you can override to handle both of these events:
`onCreate` and `onPause`.
//
It is typical for on `onCreate` method to perform tasks required to make the
activity ready for a user to use, such as configuring buttons and other UI
elements.

For more information watch the screencast above or
//

//
No. But you may be confused by the overall app structure if you don't review it.

[[uievents]]
=== UI Events

Why does code in your app run?
//
In many cases it's because a user _interacted_ with an activity&mdash;clicked a
button, entered text into a dialog box, or adjusted an on-screen control.
//
Android provides a way for each app to register _handlers_ than run when various
user interface (UI) events take place.

Our app uses these to:

* start the open file dialog
//
* start the process of capturing an image from the camera
//
* open the download file input box
//
* initiate various image transformations

In the
//
<<activitys, screencast on Android ``Activity``s>>
//
above we show how elements of the user interface are linked programmatically to
each specific action.

++++

One of the core goals of every application, including smartphone apps, is to
maintain a responsive user interface.
//
If your app freezes for long periods of time, or even short ones, users will
quickly stop using it.

Android accomplishes this by delegating certain slow operations to so-called
_background tasks_.
//
They then run independently of the user interface.
//
So your app can be simultaneously responding to new user input _and_, for
example, downloading a large file.

This is an advanced topic and not one that we expect you to master on this MP or
even on future ones.
//
But you will need to make _small_ changes to `Tasks.java` to complete MP4, so
learn more by watching the screencast above.
//
Our MP4 app uses two background tasks: one to download files and save them to
local storage, the second to run your image transformation functions.
