== IntelliJ

[.lead]
//
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ]
//
is a powerful and popular open-source integrated development environment
(IDE).
//
Many programmers utilize IDEs to simplify the process of writing, building,
testing, and debugging both large and small applications.

If you have a laptop or desktop that you plan to use for CS 125, you should
install IntelliJ on it.
//
Follow the instructions below that are appropriate for your machine.
//
But keep in mind that installing new software can be challenging, so don't be
discouraged if you get stuck.
//
We're here to help!

latest free version available as of August 2018.
//
Please install this version of IntelliJ and continue using it throughout the
semester.
//
Minor upgrades are probably safe to install.
