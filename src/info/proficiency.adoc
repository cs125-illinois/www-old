title: CS 125 Proficiency Exam
description: >
  If you are well-prepared you may choose to test out of CS 125 and continue on
  to CS 126 or CS 173. A CS 125 Proficiency Exam is given each semester. Passing
  it provides both course credit and the ability to continue on to later courses
  that have CS 125 as a prerequisite.

//
Students with significant prior programming experience and understanding of
computer science may elect to bypass CS 125 by taking a _proficiency exam_
//
footnote:[Although why would you really want to do that? CS 125 is awesome!].

This page provides information intended both to help you make the decision
whether to take the proficiency exam and prepare for the exam itself.
//
You will also want to refer to the
//
https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/[main CS proficiency exam website]
//
for more general information, including important
//
https://proficiency.cs.illinois.edu/#restrictions[restrictions on who can take
proficiency exams].

== Where to Start

If you are a CS major who has never programmed before, or a student with a deep
interest in the subject, you should take CS 125
//
footnote:[For a gentler introduction consider CS 101 or CS 105.].
//
If you have been programming since you were very young, have completed multiple
internships at tech companies, and aced
//
https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/course[AP
Computer Science A],
//
you should take the CS 125 Proficiency Exam and move on to CS 126 or 173
//
footnote:[You may actually want to consider taking the CS 225 Proficiency
Exam!].

However, for the many students that have _some_ amount of prior programming
experience and knowledge of computer science, there are no hard and fast rules
about whether to take CS 125 or bypass it via the proficiency exam.
//
One one hand, CS 125 covers considerably more material than the Computer Science
A AP exam.
//
So even if you've taken AP CS A you're likely to learn something and have a
chance to review what you already know.
//
If it's your first semester on campus you may appreciate the chance to not jump
right in to the workload of CS 126 and CS 173 as you adjust to life at college.
//
And if you already know another language well, CS 125 will both teach you Java
and prepare you for other CS@Illinois courses.

On the other hand, bypassing CS 125 brings you one semester closer to all of our
exciting upper-level courses.
//
Moving ahead may also help prepare you to obtain internships more quickly.

At the end of the day this is your decision to make based on your own specific
goals and circumstances.
//
Discuss your situation with your academic adviser.
//
And feel free to reach out to other students and advisers for advice on the
//
https://piazza.com/illinois/other/csadvising/home[CS Advising Piazza]
//
or on
//
https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/[our active subreddit].

Of course, keep in mind that you can always take the proficiency exam and see
how you do.
//
If you ace it, you'll know you're ready to move on.
//
If you don't pass, you can't go on.
//
And even if you _do_ pass, you don't have to accept the proficiency credit and
can still choose to take CS 125 to solidify your understanding before moving on.

**Finally, if you do have some prior experience and decide to take CS 125 we
will expect you to be patient and generous with the novices around you.**
//
CS 125 enrolls a lot of beginners, and they will work harder than you to catch
up and learn the things that you already know.
//
Please share your enthusiasm about computer science with them!
//
They will definitely appreciate knowing how exciting our field gets once you get
past the initial learning curve.
//
But don't act like you were born knowing this stuff.
//
Nobody is.
//
You just have more practice than they do.

[[java_and_cpp]]
=== Java and C{plus}{plus} Versions

The CS 125 Proficiency Exam is given in two versions: <<java, one with programming
examples and problems in Java>>, the <<cpp, second with them in C{plus}{plus}>>.
//
*If you are eligible for and planning to take CS 126, you must take the Java version
of the proficiency exam.*
//
CS 126 assumes that incoming students are familiar with Java, and students that
are not struggle.
//
If you are proficient in another programming language and strong enough to start
in CS 126, you should not have trouble learning enough Java to pass the
proficiency exam.

Students that are not taking CS 126 may take either the Java or the C{plus}{plus}.
version.

=== Course-Specific Restrictions

*Please note that ECE students must take
//
https://ece.illinois.edu/academics/courses/profile/ECE220[ECE 220]
//
before taking CS 173 and CS 225.*
//
For ECE students, taking the CS 125 Proficiency Exam does not represent a
prerequisite for CS 173.
//
Given this restriction, we suspect that few ECE students should consider taking
the CS 125 Proficiency Exam.

=== Online Java Practice Proficiency Exam

To aid your decision-making process we have <<prepare_java, published a set of
Java homework problems and practice Java proficiency exam online>>.
//
You can attempt these assessments from anywhere and complete them as many times
as you want.

So here is a possible algorithm for determining whether to take the CS 125
Proficiency Exam:

. Warm up with some of the homework problems included as part of the
<<prepare_java, online preparation materials>>.
//
. Attempt the <<prepare_java, practice proficiency exam>> under realistic
testing conditions: without looking things up online and within the time limit
specified.
//
. If you feel comfortable with the problems and did well, sign up to take the
Java CS 125 Proficiency Exam in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF)].
//
. If not, either continue to practice or enroll in CS
125 footnote:[and get pumped! Did we mention it's a great class?].

[[java]]
== The CS 125 Proficiency Exam (Java Version)

The CS 125 Java Proficiency Exam is a three-hour exam given in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF)].
//
The exam is comprehensive and covers all
//
link:/learn/[content covered in CS 125]
//
over the course of a typical semester.

The exam consists of 30 multiple-choice questions worth 120 points and 9
programming questions worth 180 points for a total of 300 points.
//
The point allocations are designed to help you allocate your time, although most
students should be able to complete the multiple-choice questions in less than
one hour.
//
You receive one chance to answer each multiple choice question correctly but can
attempt the programming questions as many times as you want for full credit.

The multiple-choice questions cover all core topics covered in CS 125:

. imperative programming
//
. object-oriented programming including inheritance,
//
references, polymorphism, and interfaces
//
. recursion and recursive programming,
//
. algorithm complexity and runtime analysis, particularly applied to sorting
algorithms
//
. data structures including arrays, lists, trees, and maps.

Extra enrichment topics added to each course instance are _not_ covered by the
proficiency exam.
//
These topics may vary from semester to semester, but in Spring 2019 they
comprised Android, the internet and web, Java generics, and functional
programming in Java.
//
However, note that interfaces, hashing, maps, and exceptions, _are_ fair game
for the proficiency exam.

The programming questions are also drawn from all CS 125 topic areas.
//
You should be prepared to

. work with arrays, lists and trees
//
. implement imperative and recursive algorithms, including sorting algorithms
//
. and design object classes meeting a given specification.

[[passing_java]]
=== CS 125 Java Proficiency Exam Passing Thresholds (Summer 2019)

For the Summer and Fall 2019 CS 125 Java Proficiency Exam the passing thresholds are as
follows:

* *81&ndash;100%:* _Do not take CS 125_.
//
Proceed directly to CS 126 and/or CS 173.
//
*You will not get anything out of CS 125.*
//
* *60&ndash;80%*: _You may receive proficiency credit for CS 125_.
//
However, you may still learn something in CS 125 and have a chance to strengthen
your programming abilities and conceptual knowledge before continuing.
//
The choice is up to you.
//
If you earned exactly a score closer to 60%, we'd suggest taking CS 125.
//
If you earned 80%, you should strongly consider beginning in CS 126 or CS 173.
//
* *Below 60%*: you did not pass the proficiency exam.
//
We look forward to having you in CS 125!

[[prepare_java]]
=== Preparing for the Java Proficiency Exam

To prepare for the multiple-choice portion of the Java proficiency exam please
review the
//
link:/learn/[online slides]
//
link:/lab/[lab materials],
//
and link:/MP/[MPs].

To help you prepare for the programming portion of the proficiency exam we have
published homework problems and a practice exam online.
//
To access these materials, log in to
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/[PrairieLearn]
//
using your Illinois login.
//
Then join the
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/12498/[CS 125:
Introduction to Computer Science, Proficiency Exam] course.

That will give you access to the homework problems and practice exam.
//
Each of which you may complete as many times as you want.
//
Note that some of the homework problems are harder than the programming
questions you will see on the proficiency exam.
//
But they are representative of the kinds of daily homework assignments students
complete in CS 125.
//
Actual programming questions on the proficiency exam will be
similar but not identical to the ones included in the practice exam.

The Java proficiency exam will be given in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF)],
//
meaning that only limited online resources will be available to you during the
exam.
//
For example, if you forget a bit of Java syntax you will not be able to use
Google to help jog your memory.
//
Also note that programming problems are completed in the browser using the
//
https://ace.c9.io/[Ace editor].
//
While it provides basic code editing features footnote:[like brace matching]
it the powerful features footnote:[like general autocompletion] of a
sophisticated integrated development environment like IntelliJ IDEA.
//
Part of the reason that we have published the online homework problems is to
help you become comfortable programming in this environment.

So the best way to prepare for the programming problems on the CS 125
Proficiency Exam would be to:

. Begin by mastering the homework problems to ensure that you are comfortable
with the in-browser editor and interpreting the compilation and testing results.
//
. When you are ready, reserve a two hour block of time and attempt the practice
proficiency exam uninterrupted, without distractions, and only utilizing the
documentation provided.
//
. If you can correctly complete all the questions within that time limit, you
are well-prepared for the proficiency exam.
//
Otherwise continue to practice with the homework problems and practice
proficiency exam.

[[cpp]]
== The CS 125 Proficiency Exam (C{plus}{plus} Version)

**As a reminder, CS majors _must_ take the <<java, Java version of the CS 125
Proficiency Exam>>.**
//
Students <<java_and_cpp, will not be able to continue to CS 126 by taking the
C++ version of the proficiency exam>>.

The CS 125 C{plus}{plus} Proficiency Exam is a three-hour exam.
//
Someday we will have a computer-based edition, but as of Fall 2019 the
C{plus}{plus} version is still a written exam.
//
Content coverage is the same as the <<java, Java version>>, but the exam format
is different.
//
It consists of five questions that combine algorithm analysis, programming,
computational thinking, and other skills taught in CS 125.
