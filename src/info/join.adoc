//
Ready to help staff the most innovative course on campus?
//
footnote:[According to us, obviously]

CS 125 relies on both credit-earning and paid staff to help teach computer
science and programming to hundreds of students.
//
If you've taken the course or have equivalent knowledge, you're ready to
<<ca, directly help>> other students and earn course credit.
//
And if you'd prefer to work behind the scenes and build novel tools that help
power CS 125, we have <<cd, paid development positions>> as well.
//
We're also looking for <<data, data scientists>> to derive insights
from the massive data sets that CS 125 produces each semester.

[[ca]]
== Course Assistant

As a course assistant (CA), you'll interact directly with students
during office hours and in labs.
//
You'll be the wise counselor, the one providing encouragement, and provide a
sympathetic ear to students when they are just plain frustrated footnote:[That
happens!].

Being a CS 125 CA is a 3&ndash;5 hour per week time commitment.
//
CAs are not paid, but you will earn course credit and receive training to
improve your ability to help other students.
//
To read more about the CA position and apply
//
https://forms.gle/7Mq9uAa6tUUjWwQF9[click here].
//
However, we want to emphasize a few things:

. *You do not need to have aced the class to be a CA or to become a good CA.*
//
Helping others with their code requires training and practice. We'll provide
both.
//
And if you've struggled a bit you'll be in a better position to empathize with
struggling students.
//
. *Teaching other students will help _you_ learn the material better.*
//
So this is a great thing to do before you move on to CS 225&mdash;particularly
if you aren't taking CS 126.

[[cd]]
== Course Developers

CS 125 also has a smaller set of paid undergraduate staff positions.
//
With the CAs available to staff office hours and hold labs, our paid positions
involve little to no student contact footnote:[Unless your specific project
requires it.].
//
Instead, we turn you loose on exciting and challenging development projects
designed to make the course better in the long run.
//
Past CS 125 course developers have worked on our grade return system, course
data analysis, plagiarism detection, MP development, and helped plan our first
//
link:/info/fair/[final project fair].
//
Course developer positions are 10 hour / week positions with pay starting at $11
/ hour but negotiable for experienced developers.

We always have a variety of exciting projects involving lots of different
technologies and environments.
//
Peruse the link:/tech/ideas[full list here].
//
But we're very flexible about what course developers work on and happy to work with
you to strengthen your skill set.
//
We are excited about these projects and want them to make forward
progress&mdash;but overall this is primarily a learning experience for the
course developers.

If this sounds up your alley, please

[[data]]
== Course Data Analysts

For the 2018&ndash;2019 academic year we are also looking to hire several data
analysts.
//
CS 125 generates _a lot_ of data, and will generate even more as the course gets
larger and we instrument more parts of the class.
//
https://goo.gl/eHwk8J[Several development projects]
//
involve improving our existing instrumentation, to measure things like how much
time students spend working on each MP and in office hours.
//
We should be able to harness this data to understand and improve the course.
//
Data analyst positions are 10 hour / week positions with pay starting at $11 /
hour but negotiable for experienced developers.

If that sounds like a fun challenge, please also
//
https://goo.gl/forms/uO3r2zEQVB8TPJen1[click here]
//
to find out more and apply.
//
Note that the application is the same as that for <<cd, course developers>>, so
please indicate your interest in the data analyst position when you apply.
