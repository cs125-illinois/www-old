You will find the following resources helpful to your success in CS 125.

To participate in CS 125 you need to activate Google Apps integration for your
@illinois.edu email account.
//
We use Google login in many places:
//
to allow you to access the {forum} and
//
link:/m/grades/[see your grades online],
//
and for forms and other surveys that we send out during the semester.

Here's what to do:

. Start https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/google-apps-illinois[here]
and then click on the appropriate link.
//
. https://techservices.illinois.edu/services/google-apps-illinois[This is the
link] for undergraduates.
//
You will need to access your
//
https://cloud-dashboard.illinois.edu/[cloud dashboard]
//
and enable Google Apps integration with your `@illinois.edu` email address.
//
The process requires accepting a license agreement.
//
. Now go to https://www.google.com[Google].
//
If you are not logged in, click "Login" in the upper right hand corner.
//
Otherwise, click your avatar and choose "Add Account".
//
This should redirect you to the familiar Illinois Active Directory log in page.
//
. Once you have completed these steps, you should have a choice of login
options when you return to the forum.
//
Choose your `@illinois.edu` address and you will be able to access and participate
in the forum.

[[videos]]
== Videos

Lectures are being taped this semester and will be available on our
//
link://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8L44j0A6LAlC4FM8IiNx-w/videos[YouTube channel]
//
at some point soon.

[[hours]]
== Office Hours

[.lead]
//
Need help?
//
Come get it!
//
We have office hours pretty much all day, every day, and there is a team of
friendly
//
link:/info/people[course staff]
//
waiting to help you.

CS 125 holds _many hours_ of office hours per week:
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[check the calendar for specific dates and times].
//
Every office hour is manned by at least one
//
link:/info/people#tas[teaching assistant]
//
and at least one *but probably many*
//
link:/info/people#cas[course assistants].

Almost all office hours are held in and around *Siebel 0403*&mdash;our dedicated
CS 125 space.
//
We are also exploring holding office hours in some of the residence halls this
semester.

*We suggest scheduling between 4 and 6 hours when you will go to office hours
and work on the current MP.*
//
That way you're in the right place when you need help, which you probably
will&mdash;often.
//
You don't need to have a question to come to office hours.
//
Just come to work around other students and have fun with the course staff.

However, note that the course staff do not exist to complete the assignments for
you.
//
Sometimes they may just help get you unstuck before moving on to help another
student.
//
You should expect to do almost all of the work yourself, but expect the course
staff to provide helpful advice, encouragement, and sometimes a hint or two here
and there.

[[forum]]
== Forum

We have set up a
//
https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/[Discourse forum]
//
for CS 125.
//
The forum is the right place to ask questions, get help, and interact with other
students and the course staff outside of lectures, labs, and office hours.
//
*Please use it for all course-related questions that are not of a sensitive
nature*, since answering them there helps other students with the same
question.
//
To log in, you will need to
//
link:#google[active Google Apps integration]
//
for your @illinois.edu email account.

Please also get in the habit of _searching the forum_ before asking a question.
//
Chances are fairly good that your question has already been asked and answered,
which means that you can find out what you wanted to know immediately!
//
On public forums this is also considered good forum etiquette.

=== Why Not Piazza?

We are using the excellent
//
https://github.com/discourse/discourse[open-source]
//
https://www.discourse.org/[Discourse] forum software
//
to power our course forum.
//
Why aren't we using https://piazza.com/[Piazza], which is fairly popular in the
educational space?
//
There are four main reasons that we consider Discourse a better choice for CS
125:

. *Discourse enables discussion.*
//
Piazza is designed for students to converge to one answer.
//
But in computer science, there are frequently multiple ways to approach a
problem, and solutions frequently emerge through a conversation.
//
. *Discourse has a future.*
//
Unlike Piazza, Discourse is increasingly used outside academia by companies to
host product and technology discussion forums, and by other online communities.
//
Familiarity with it will benefit you as you continue your explorations in
computer science.
//
. *Discourse is better tech.*
//
Discourse is a modern, responsive, and interactive web application.
//
Piazza... is not.
//
As budding computer scientists, we want to expose you to the best tech out there
so that you are inspired by the kind of things that you will soon be able to
create.
//
. *Discourse is
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software[free and open
source].*
//
We believe in the power of the open source community, and in encouraging you to
share _your_ creations freely and openly.
//
Discourse is a great example of what talented volunteers can build when they
work together.

[[emp]]
== CS 199 EMP: Even More Practice

To further aid beginners CS 125 runs a weekly help session as a separate
1-credit course called
//
https://courses.illinois.edu/search/schedule/2020/spring/CS/199?sess=[CS 199:
EMP].
//
*Note that you should sign up for CS 199 25, not one of the other CS 199
sections.*
//
EMP stands for _Even More Practice_, and more practice is what you are going to
get if you come.

EMP is held on *Thursdays from 5&ndash;6:50PM in Everitt 2310.*
//
It's on the
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[course calendar].
//
We will have a large number of course assistants there to provide personalized
help.
//
Many were CS beginners themselves not that long ago.

This semester EMP is open to _all_ CS 125 students.
//
If you register for EMP, you'll be expected to attend regularly.
//
But even if you don't, feel free to drop by at any point when you feel confused
or need a bit of extra help with the lecture material.

However, *EMP is not extra office hours.*
//
Don't come expecting to get help on the assignments&mdash;that's what office
hours are for.
//
EMP will focus exclusively on reviewing and strengthening material and concepts
covered in lecture.

////
*EMP is open for registration.*
//
You should sign up for CS 199 Section EMP with Geoffrey Challen.
//
Meetings and meeting locations are on the
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[course calendar].
