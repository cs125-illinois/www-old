You will find the following resources helpful to your success in CS 125.

[[videos]]
== Videos

The 10AM lectures are being taped this semester and will be available at
//
https://echo360.org/section/8cef8dac-8c35-444a-85a6-d4148eca942f/home[this
Echo360 link].
//
We may also begin posting lecture videos on our
//
link://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8L44j0A6LAlC4FM8IiNx-w/videos[YouTube channel]
//
at some point during the semester.
//
But they will definitely be available on
//
https://echo360.org/section/8cef8dac-8c35-444a-85a6-d4148eca942f/home[Echo360].

[[hours]]
== Office Hours

[.lead]
//
Need help?
//
Come get it!
//
We have office hours pretty much all day, every day, and there is a team of
friendly
//
link:/info/people[course staff]
//
waiting to help you.

CS 125 holds _48 hours_ of office hours per week:
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[9AM&ndash;7PM Monday through Thursday and
9AM&ndash;5PM Friday].
//
Every office hour is manned by at least one
//
link:/info/people#tas[teaching assistant]
//
and at least one *but probably many*
//
link:/info/people#cas[course assistants].
//
All office hours are held in and around Siebel 0226.

*We suggest scheduling between 4 and 6 hours when you will go to office hours
and work on the current MP.*
//
That way you're in the right place when you need help, which you probably
will&mdash;often.
//
You don't need to have a question to come to office hours.
//
Just come to work around other students and have fun with the course staff.

However, note that the course staff do not exist to complete the assignments for
you.
//
Sometimes they may just help get you unstuck before moving on to help another
student.
//
You should expect to do almost all of the work yourself, but expect the course
staff to provide helpful advice, encouragement, and sometimes a hint or two here
and there.

[[forum]]
== Forum

We have set up a
//
https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/[Discourse forum]
//
for CS 125.
//
The forum is the right place to ask questions, get help, and interact with other
students and the course staff outside of lectures, labs, and office hours.
//
*Please use it for all course-related questions that are not of a sensitive
nature*, since answering them there helps other students with the same
question.

Please also get in the habit of _searching the forum_ before asking a question.
//
Chances are fairly good that your question has already been asked and answered,
which means that you can find out what you wanted to know immediately!
//
On public forums this is also considered good forum etiquette.

{forum} using your @illinois.edu email account.
//
That may require activating Google Apps on your Illinois account.
//
Here's what to do:

. Visit https://answers.uillinois.edu/illinois/47880[this site].
//
Click on the appropriate link&mdash;undergraduates, or faculty staff and
graduate students&mdash;and make sure that you have enabled Google Apps
integration.
//
The process requires accepting a license agreement.
//
. Now go to https://www.google.com[Google].
//
If you are not logged in, click "Login" in the upper right hand corner.
//
Otherwise, click your avatar and choose "Add Account".
//
This should redirect you to the familiar Illinois Active Directory log in page.
//
. Once you have completed these steps, you should have a choice of login
options when you return to the forum.
//
Choose your @illinois.edu address and you will be able to access and participate
in the forum.

=== Why Not Piazza?

We are using the excellent
//
https://github.com/discourse/discourse[open-source]
//
https://www.discourse.org/[Discourse] forum software
//
to power our course forum.
//
Why aren't we using https://piazza.com/[Piazza], which is fairly popular in the
educational space?
//
There are four main reasons that we consider Discourse a better choice for CS
125:

. *Discourse enables discussion.*
//
Piazza is designed for students to converge to one answer.
//
But in computer science, there are frequently multiple ways to approach a
problem, and solutions frequently emerge through a conversation.
//
. *Discourse has a future.*
//
Unlike Piazza, Discourse is increasingly used outside academia by companies to
host product and technology discussion forums, and by other online communities.
//
Familiarity with it will benefit you as you continue your explorations in
computer science.
//
. *Discourse is better tech.*
//
Discourse is a modern, responsive, and interactive web application.
//
Piazza... is not.
//
As budding computer scientists, we want to expose you to the best tech out there
so that you are inspired by the kind of things that you will soon be able to
create.
//
. *Discourse is
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software[free and open
source].*
//
We believe in the power of the open source community, and in encouraging you to
share _your_ creations freely and openly.
//
Discourse is a great example of what talented volunteers can build when they
work together.

[[emp]]
== CS 199 EMP: Even More Practice

To further aid beginners CS 125 runs a weekly help session as a separate
1-credit course called
//
https://courses.illinois.edu/search/schedule/2018/spring/CS/199?sess=[CS 199:
EMP].
//
EMP stands for _Even More Practice_, and more practice is what you are going to
get if you come.

EMP is held on *Mondays from 5&ndash;6:50PM in Siebel 1404.*
//
It's on the
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[course calendar].
//
We will have a large number of course assistants there to provide personalized
help.
//
Many were CS beginners themselves not that long ago.

This semester EMP is open to _all_ CS 125 students.
//
If you register for EMP, you'll be expected to attend regularly.
//
But even if you don't, feel free to drop by at any point when you feel confused
or need a bit of extra help with the lecture material.

However, *EMP is not extra office hours.*
//
Don't come expecting to get help on the assignments&mdash;that's what office
hours are for.
//
EMP will focus exclusively on reviewing and strengthening material and concepts
covered in lecture.

In Spring 2018 EMP will open for registration at *noon on Monday 1/22/2018*.
//
You should sign up for CS 199 Section EMP with Geoffrey Challen.
//
The first meeting only will be *DCL 1310*&mdash;the rest will be in Siebel 1404.
//
Meetings and meeting locations are on the
//
link:/info/syllabus#calendar[course calendar].

[[cs196]]
== CS 196

http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu/[CS 196] is the 1-credit honors section of CS 125.
//
It has its own
//
http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu/[website], forum, and other sources of information.
//
Please use those resources to ask questions about CS 196.

This semester registration for CS 196 will open at *noon on Monday 1/22/2018*.

[[textbook]]
== Online Textbook

We may assign readings from the comprehensive and free online textbook
//
http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[Introduction to Programming Using Java, Seventh
Edition],
//
by
//
http://math.hws.edu/eck/[David J. Eck]
//
of
//
http://www2.hws.edu/[Hobart and William Smith Colleges].
//
This textbook is available in several formats, including as a
//
http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes7-linked.pdf[PDF].
//
There are also examples programs included&mdash;see the
//
http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[website]
//
for more details.

[[turings]]
== Turing's Craft

We assign small Java programming exercises using an online tool called
https://www.turingscraft.com/[Turing's Craft].
//
Completion of these exercises is worth 5% of your letter grade.
//
*To receive credit you must sign up using your @illinois.edu email address.*

Here is how to sign up for an account:

. Go to the https://www.turingscraft.com/register.php[Turing's Craft
registration page].
//
. *Enter your @illinois.edu email address.*
//
If you use another email address, you will not receive credit.
//
Turing's Craft should enforce this now, but please be careful to be sure that
you don't lose out on these points.
//
. Continue through the rest of the registration dialog.
//
When prompted, using the semester-specific registration code
//
[.spelling_exception]_UIUC-26107-CBVY-35_.

You will be able to complete 10 Turing's Craft exercises for free.
//
To continue, you will need to pay $25 to upgrade your account.

[[online]]
== Other Online Resources

The internet is full of information, and _particularly_ full of information
about computer science.
//
We will not curate a list of online resources here, since Google is by far the
best way to find out more.
//
But here are a few examples of high-quality materials that may help you learn
Java:

* *https://www.codecademy.com/[Codecademy]* has great interactive online
tutorials about many programming languages, including
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java[Java].
//
* http://www.learnjavaonline.org/[Learn Java Online] provides an interactive
web-based learning experience specifically tailored to Java.
//
* *https://www.coursera.org/[Coursera]* also has many
https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&query=java[Java-based courses]
from a variety of excellent universities.
//
https://www.edx.org/[EdX] and https://www.udacity.com[Udacity] do as well.
//
* The online programming practice site https://www.hackerrank.com/[HackerRank]
has a https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-introduction[series of
introductory Java questions]

This list is just the tip of the iceberg, but it should make it clear that _if
you want to learn Java, you can_.
//
We're hear to provide help and inspiration along the way.
