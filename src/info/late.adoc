//
You _can_ join CS 125 late&mdash;during the first few weeks of the semester.
//
But you'll need to catch up right away.
//
This page contains instructions on how to do that.

Please follow the steps below carefully.

== Enable Google Apps Integration

Follow
//
link:/info/resources#google[these instructions]
//
to activate Google login for your `@illinois.edu` email address.

== Sign Up for Temporary Course Access

It can take up to a day for your registration to appear in our systems.
//
While you are waiting, we suggest you
//
https://forms.gle/Akn4t4Cfgym5nAJM6[use this form]
//
to sign up to receive _temporary_ access to the Fall 2019 course forum and be
put on our mailing lists.
//
Once you complete the form, wait one hour and you should be able to log in to
the course forum.

Note that temporary access will end on 9/16/2019, so you must officially register
before that point.

== Follow the Lab 0 Instructions

At this point you should go through the steps in
//
link:/lab/0/[Lab 0].

== Review the Lecture Slides and Videos

As you complete the homework you'll want to go through our
//
link:/learn/[online lecture slides]
//
and view any videos that are available.
//
If videos for this semester have not yet been posted you can review videso from
a previous semester.
//
The content covered in the first few weeks doesn't change much from semester to
semester.

== Complete the Homework

Once you have completed the link:/lab/0/[Lab 0] instructions you should make
sure that you have finished all available
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/33373/assessments[homework problems].
//
**Note that the first set of homework problems is available until the end of the
second week of class.**
//
So you have time to catch up and finish them.

== If You Missed Our First Quiz...

If you missed our first CBTF Quiz you can take it after completing our _second_
CBTF quiz during the second week of class.
//
Quiz 0 is extremely easy and will only take you 5 minutes.
//
So you can take it during the time slot you reserve to take Quiz 1.

== Keep In Mind

* We don't start counting lecture participation until the third week of class
//
* We don't start counting lab participation until the third week of class
//
* All of the first week week's worth of homework will be due at the end of the
second week of class

Good luck catching up!
