* Which is great, because I _love_ the internet!

== Internet As Wired Infrastructure

[.lead]
//
The internet comprises an enormous amount of physical infrastructure.

[.s]
//
* *Most of it is _wired_, not wireless.* Wireless is mainly used for the first
hop.
//
* *Most of it is _fiber_ (glass), not copper.* Signals degrade quickly in copper
but travel faster and with less attenuation in glass footnote:[This is why
https://www.dow.com/en-us/electrical/markets/telecommunications/fiber-optic-cable[Dow
Corning] has such a nice visitor center!]. Copper is only used for the last 100
meters.
//
* *The internet wouldn't exist without fiber optic cable.* It's one of the
wonders of the modern world. It's not just glass, it's _really clear_ glass.

== An Internet Journey

[.lead]
If you want to learn more, you can join me as we follow a cable from my former
office to the edge of our campus network.

* https://youtu.be/KHvHCnRCWYc[First hop out of my office]
//
* https://youtu.be/uPyWqblKuYs[Next hop to the network closet on my floor].
//
Here copper gives way to fiber.
//
* https://youtu.be/2DC1fYjURag[My next hop in the basement networking closet]
//
* https://youtu.be/5p6DdQCPh7Q[My last hop on campus].
//
At this point all of the campus network traffic leaves on only a few slim fiber
optic cable.

== Internet As Wireless Infrastructure

[.lead]
//
In recent years we've also built out a huge amount of _wireless_ internet
infrastructure.

[.s]
//
* *Short range wireless* is dominated by
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi[WiFi]
//
and what you use when you're on campus, at home, or at a coffee shop
//
* *Medium-range wireless* is used to provide connectivity to mobile devices like
smartphones over longer distances.
//
You usually buy this from a cellular provider like Verizon or Sprint.

== Internet As Connectivity

[.lead]
//
The result is that by connecting a computer to the internet, you are now
connected to _4 billion_ other computers.

[.s]
//
* Many times the first connection is _wireless_
//
* But after that point there is literally a wire that you can follow from your
computer to the other computer

== The Internet Protocol (IP)

[.lead]
//
The
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[Internet Protocol (IP)]
//
consists of a series of agreements that allow internet-connected devices to
communicate.

[.s]
//
* *What do we call each other?*
//
IP specifies the format of internet protocol addresses, also called IP
addresses.
** Here's one: `192.17.96.8` (IPv4)
** Here's a new one: `2607:f8b0:4009:807::2004` (IPv6)
//
* *How are our message structured?*
//
IP specifies a _format_ for each message (or datagram) exchanged across the
internet.

The core internet protocols were invented by a bunch of graduate students,
including Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn.

*They changed the world.*
