== Review: Variable Types

[.lead]
//
Java has _eight_
//
http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/java/language/java-data.html[primitive data types].

All other data in Java is represented by _combinations_ of these building blocks.
//
You can break them into four categories:

//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`
//
. *Character*: `char`
//
. *True or false*: `boolean`

[[IffEzqifWagrJAUVhbtbZpBeXbJOthRh]]
== Why Are There Multiple Numeric Types?

[.lead]
//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`

[.s]
--
Different types take up different amounts of _computer memory_ and so can store
different values.
--

[.s]
--
*Don't worry too much about how things are stored yet.* But the limits are
important to understand.

== Why Types

[.s.lead]
//
* Types force you to specify how much space you need to store your data. That
can make your program more efficient
//
* Types also help catch many common programming errors

[[thNGNuVJZgpjeuixrcjzWZgDtmmWCvwM]]
== Our Types

[.lead]
//
In CS 125 we'll primarily be dealing with just a few of Java's primitive types:

[.s]
//
* `int` for storing integers
//
* `double` for storing floating point values
//
* `boolean` for storing truth values

[[bAuWhpDPmVGgDaepoowJukwlfVQsJPdR]]
== Comparisons

[.lead]
//
Java also allows me to compare variables: either against literal values, or
against other variables.

This is basis for _simple decision making_.

[[EuddnTejTlEZaIAttmJUDwqxLAWdYNQd]]
== Simple Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int tester = 10;
// This is equality
System.out.println(tester == 10);
....

[[kfjlldprRQUOtUaTuYveJPZEbFCgHlCU]]
== A Common Mistake

[.lead]
//
* `a = 10` means *set a to 10*
//
* `a == 10` means *test if a is equal to 10*

[[uOanIxfYhyBAYDDSDumbwovkhBiwNNcg]]
== Don't Get Confused

[role='janini']
....
int tester = 10;
// This is equality
System.out.println(tester == 10);
// This is not
System.out.println(tester = 5);
System.out.println(tester);
....

[[NZRZqEBsBPejsjEIMEUExRtpUZwnPHvN]]
== Variable Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first > first);
....

[[JXtQIUEitmTgnNBVMLHYYnkyMeHylXzT]]
== More Complex Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
// Let's try out ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
System.out.println(first + second == 30);
System.out.println(first - second <= 10);
....

== Questions About Simple Comparisons?

[[BueiLwuNKbnJPZVcrKBddwHYcdYQyvjx]]
== Compound Comparisons

[.lead]
//
We can combine multiple comparisons together using logical and (`&&`) and or
(`||`) operators.

[[vDROZOQyBuCsHvUlGCATsKriCrZxCmeK]]
== ! Combining Comparisons

[role='janini']
....
int first = 10;
System.out.println(first > 5 && first < 10);
System.out.println(first < 10 && first > 5);
System.out.println(first > 10 || first > 5);
System.out.println(first > 10 || false);
....

[[FBXXgCFgySnrwZHYfSoUHPKWaxwklwjZ]]
== Evaluation Order and Grouping

[.lead]
//
There are a few more rules that Java applies when evaluating conditionals
expressions:

[.s]
//
* Conditionals are always evaluated from left to right, and evaluation stops as
soon as the result is known.
//
* Comparisons can be grouped using parentheses (`(` and `)`)
//
* But we'll try and keep our comparisons simple for now&mdash;and you should
too!

[[OHLyesdredLunhwymnQglBoPznFWnGEv]]
== ! Grouping Comparisons

[.janini.smallest]
....
int first = 10;
System.out.println((first > 0 && first < 10) || (first == 10));
System.out.println((first > 0 && first < 10) && (first == 10));
System.out.println(first < 10 && (first == 0 || first == 10));
....

[[kTKjdTjMotZBlcgraocBlOSIGadWncvF]]
== Comparisons Enable Decisions

[role='janini']
....
// Comparisons enable decisions
int first = 10;
if (first > 20) {
  System.out.println("First is greater than 20");
} else {
  System.out.println("First is not greater than 20");
}
....

[[ZVszIucHlwfpNThvCPzvAuGXDQoXGDJm]]
== `if-else`

[.lead]
//
`if-else` statements are the building block for programmatic decision making:

[.s]
//
* _if_ something is true, do one thing;
//
* _otherwise_, if something else is true, do some other thing;
//
* _otherwise_, if something else is true, do some other thing;
//
* etc.

[[mKZSZKIqiozOhiBMXfrUaxnAYmcEWiNU]]
== `if-elseif-elseif-else`

[.lead]
`if` statements can have multiple clauses:

[source,java]
----
if (firstThing) {
  // do one thing
} else if (secondThing) {
  // do another thing
} else if (thirdThing) {
  // another thing
} else {
  // run if firstThing, secondThing, and thirdThing are all false
}
----

`else` statements are run if no if statement matches.

[[CDpGeuKlxKgJwOfLsqWUIfCazJSauLSt]]
== ! Only One Statement Runs

[role='janini']
....
// Only the first matching branch of if is executed
int comparison = 10;
if (comparison > 5) {
  System.out.println("I'll be executed");
} else if (comparison > 3) {
  System.out.println("I won't be executed");
} else {
  System.out.println("I definitely won't be executed");
}
....

[[ulsvDseRWSMaJGiZXigRkKHBdYgQEGwm]]
== Remember: At Most One Statement Runs

[.lead]
//
*In any if statement, at most one statement is executed.*

[.s]
//
* If there is an `else` statement _exactly_ one statement runs
//
* If there is _not_ an `else` statement _at most_ one statement runs, but it's
possible than no statement runs

[[sCTwbrbupLHdZwRvBbUQlfGFoutbJTfB]]
== Somewhat Useful Example

[role='janini']
....
// Create an int called numSuperBowls, and then add 1 to it
// if sanFranciscoWinsAgain is true
....

[[fcnIiRcbbDBZyWPgBSCPEDBMiSUCxLEy]]
== Nested Conditionals

[.lead]
`if` statements can be nested inside other `if` statements

[source,java]
----
if (testMe) {
  if (testMeAgain) {
    // I am well tested
  } else {
    // I'm only moderated well-tested
  }
} else {
  // You need to write better tests
}
----

[[PgMLuXcxwdrkzLNqnpFFWLNAsIHpiYTB]]
== Variable Scope

[.lead]
//
`if` statements provide our first example of a _block_ of code.

[source,java]
----
if (...) {
  // I'm a block of code
}
----

[.s]
//
* Blocks are enclosed by braces and can have multiple statements
//
* Variables declared _inside_ a block are not visible _outside_ it...
//
* But variables declared outside (and prior to) a block _are_ visible _inside_ it

[[ECKCAOoavGvvNXrOtQqqIZMxNKnbmBAj]]
== !Practice With Scope
[role='janini']
....
int outside = 5;
if (true) {
  int inside = 10;
  System.out.println(outside);
}
System.out.println(inside);
....

[[uyjfRCHsbnKWGDOzAwWeAPodEDLQbWjP]]
== Indentation Hints

[.lead]
//
Assuming you are indenting your code properly, a general rule of thumb about
scope:

[.s]
//
* You *can* access variables "to the left"
//
* You *cannot* access variables "to the right"

(Where directions are defined relative to the start of the line of code you are
writing.)

[[eUWkVtCUwaoLWfYANZKlTLvlRthqeEIz]]
== !Practice With Scope
[role='janini']
....
int outside = 5;
if (true) {
  int inside = 10;
  // outside is to my left, so OK
  System.out.println(outside);
}
// inside is to my right, so bad
System.out.println(inside);

== Preparing for Quizzes

[.lead]
//
Your first real CS 125 quiz starts today in the CBTF.
//
Here's how to prepare.

[.s]
//
* **Don't take the quiz on Monday before class.**
//
Quizzes may cover material introduced or reviewed on Monday.
//
* Multiple-choice questions will test content covered in class&mdash;so
review the slides
//
* Also read the assigned chapter in
//
https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Making-Tribe-Remaking-World/dp/0735220565["Coders"].
//
* Programming questions will be quite similar to the homework problems&mdash;so
review them too
//
* You have _unlimited_ attempts on the programming questions but limited
attempts on the multiple-choice questions
