//
== But That Means

[.lead]
//
// Each correct homework submission required _5_ incorrect submissions.

So when you don't succeed, try, try, try, try, again.

== You Worked _Really Hard_ To Get Here

Don't forget it. That's what it takes. So don't stop!

[[ZzEppBgexaYzXFgiIciHdeUeCkxJYYwO]]
== How Did the Beginners Do?

[.lead]
//
*Quite well*:

* Median grade for the most-experienced students: 87
//
* Median grade for the _least_ experienced students: [.s]#82#

[[fFAnpUjGMjAJQiFlnzfnTgbafphVoexn]]
== Blue v. Orange

[.s]
//
* Blue Team MP Median: 80
//
* Orange Team MP Median: 81

So the split deadline didn't produce a big change in scores.
//
We're going to leave this as-is.

== What Now?

[[nncioidnzgcboyhnMYfzXiJuyeiwGoiJ]]
== Downstream Courses

[.s]
//
* **CS 126**: If you are able to enroll in CS 126, good luck and have fun...
//
* **~CS 126**: ...but that's like a handful of you.
//
So if you _can't_ take CS 126, please do something to be able to continue
programming: CS 196, CS 125 CA, side projects, whatever.
//
* If you take 9 months off and then show up in CS 225 _you will struggle_

== Course Evaluations

[.lead]
//
We take your feedback _very_ seriously.
//
We want CS 125 to improve every semester.

[.s]
//
* Unfortunately the paper forms are slow and the boxes are small, so...
//
* We're also distributing an online survey today that mimics the ICES forms.
//
* **Please complete it _and_ the papers forms!** That way we can get your feedback
right away and at more length.
//
* Also don't miss the top two boxes on the form&mdash;they are squished together
for some reason.
