== ! Java Method Overloading

[.janini.small]
....
static int sum(int first, int second) {
  return first + second;
}
static double sum(double first, double second) {
  return first + second;
}
System.out.println(sum(10, 20));

== Java Method Overloading

[.lead]
//
Java uses _both_ the function name _and_ the the list of arguments and types to
determine which function to call.

Together they are called the _function signature_.

[.s]
//
. *Does the function have the right name?*
//
. *Does the function take the right arguments in the right order?*
//
. Java will also try to convert types to find a match as long as no loss of
precision occurs

== Function Input Validation

[.lead]
//
A common function design pattern is to _check your inputs at the top_.

Think about all the bad inputs you could possibly get from the caller.

[source,java]
----
int sum(int[] numbers) {
  // check numbers to make sure it's sane
}

== `null` Arrays

[.lead]
//
What is the value of array declared below?

[source,java]
----
int[] output = null;
System.out.println(output);
----

[.s]
//
* Java has a special value that can be used to indicate that an object has not
been initialized: `null`.
//
* `null` is not a valid object: it has no properties or methods that you can
use.
//
* Attempts to use `null` will result in an error

*Always check objects for `null`.*

Java and other Java-like languages now also have better primitives for dealing
with `null` and avoiding

== Casting

[.lead]
//
If you want to _force_ Java to convert a variable from one type to another you
can try applying a _cast_.

[source,java]
----
int i = 10;
double d = i; // This works since no information is lost
i = d; // This does not work since we'd have to throw out the fraction
i = (int) d; // But we can force Java to do it

== String Reverse

[.lead]
//
Given a `String`, return it in reverse order.

*First, what is our algorithm?*
//
I can think of at least three ways to do this...

[.s]
//
. Examine each character in the input `String`
//
. Put it in the right place in the output `String`

== Dropped Grade Policy

[.lead]
//
CS 125 has a generous dropped grade policy.
//
However, these are _not_ "get out of class free" cards.

[.s.small]
//
* Dropped lectures and labs are pre-excused absences intended to accommodate
_all_ the reasons you might miss class or not complete a homework problem:
sickness, family emergencies, travel, religious obligations, extracurricular
activities, etc.
//
* *As a result we don't excuse absences.*
//
Please don't email us about this.
//
* *We expect you to try to attend and complete everything.*
//
But the dropped grades are for times when circumstances intervene.
//
* If you use them up skipping class just because you don't feel like coming, and
then your fish dies and you are bereft, you don't get more.
