== Algorithms

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm[Algorithm]:
//
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
//
____

As computer scientists, we implement algorithms by having computers:

[.s]
//
* Perform simple calculations
//
* Store the results
//
* Make simple decisions
//
* Do things over and over again as fast as possible

[[JGTmnbkHwboAihJynfxUiXyvQBMcEFus]]
== Data Structures

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure[Data structure]:
//
a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or
operations that can be applied to the data.
//
____

As Java programmers we implement more complicated data structures using a mix
of:

[.s]
//
* Primitive types and objects to _store_ and organize data values
//
* Existing data structures like arrays
//
* References to reflect relationships among objects

[[YumtfuKBaLhokozilRqGVVRzrwypGfOd]]
== Algorithms and Data Structures

[.lead]
//
Algorithms and data structures are _highly complementary_:

[.s]
//
* We will implement algorithms that utilize specific features of data structures
//
* We will implement data structures to support specific algorithms
//
* We will use our existing imperative and object-oriented ideas along the way
//
* And we'll introduce a few more important ideas along the way

== Example: Greatest Common Denominator

[quote]
//
____
//
In mathematics, the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor[greatest common divisor
(GCD)]
//
of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer
that divides each of the integers.

What's a simpler approach?

[[JssrqejyvIyvwsXyrCkspJKxdKDMQLRk]]
== Brute Force Solution

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search[Brute force solution]:
//
a very general problem-solving technique that consists of systematically
enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each
candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
//
____

[.s]
//
* Computers today are very, _very_ fast
//
* So try the simple thing first
//
* If it's too slow, try something a bit more sophisticated

== You Don't Need the Fastest Algorithm to Change the World

That's a good thing!

[[KTGrHQJiStmgrdjVjvLJBvdHTokGvbGK]]
== But Speed Eventually Matters

[.lead]
//
Even if you don't at the beginning, you will eventually start to care about how
fast your code runs.
//
For any number of the following reasons:

[.s]
//
* You start to have larger problems to solve.
//
* You're embarrassed that your algorithm makes your incredibly fast computer
seem slow
//
* You have to start paying for machines
//
* Your customer tells you that your program is too slow
//
* You're in a job interview

[[XIAanwdDVyALfCEgZLNQljuMKfylgtld]]
== So How Long Will It Take?

[.lead]
//
How long will our brute force GCD algorithm take?

[.s]
//
* To compute the GCD of 4 and 6
//
* To compute the GCD of 185 and 2045
//
* To compute the GCD of M and N

[[UgJrBAbxmpaEtUFaigwcjbLnlTfcIOoF]]
== Algorithm Analysis

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms[Algorithm analysis]:
//
the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the
amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.
//
____

[[bzGJKlpimKGIHSRpMdozAZQHDQCfHegP]]
== At The Limit

[.lead]
//
We're usually want to analyze an algorithm in the general case, rather than for
a specific set of inputs.

[.s]
//
* How does the algorithm perform on arbitrarily difficult or large inputs?
//
* What are the best, average, and worst-case running times?
//
* *How is the algorithm's performance related to its inputs?*

[[wZpYuIQdhBkDdYLdffvSWUUvbhDCqzoG]]
== Big-O Notation

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Product[Big-O notation]
//
is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
//
____

[.lead]
//
Put another way: we want to _estimate_ what happens as the problem gets really,
really hard.

(At this point non-critical components of the algorithm's performance also cease
to matter.)

[[efsgaXBTFHpEdxGrToSwqgJExyuqqvqN]]
== Dumb Algorithm, Clever Algorithm

[.s.lead]
//
A *dumb* algorithm can move a problem _up_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n) to O(n^2). (Our sort test is dumb. The problem is O(n).)

[.s.lead]
//
A *smart* algorithm can move a problem _down_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n^2) to O(n log n). (Euclid's Method GCD is smart. The problem
is O(log(N)).)
