== What Are Computers Good At?

. [.line-through]#Basic math#
//
. [.line-through]#Simple decision making#
//
. [.line-through]#Doing things over and over again very, very fast#
//
. [.line-through]#Storing data#
//
. And communicating (we'll get there)

[[ebsIAGHktJXCWiXlllplCDkytNHXBEjq]]
== What's Next?

[.lead]
//
These are the three main challenges that will occupy us for the remainder of the
semester:

[.s]
//
* **Algorithms**: How do we use computers to solve problems?
//
* **Data structures**: How do we structure information to enable efficient
algorithms?
//
* **Software development**: How do we write, debug, test, and publish _good_
computer software?
//
* And we're going to have _a lot of fun_ continuing to learn everything and
anything about how computers and computer systems work.

[[vrCcLFuUvwOmdCBjYCObdECLzGvjWCwm]]
== How Do We Structure Good Computer Programs?

[.s]
//
. Break our code into reusable, testable, and understandable pieces
//
. Combine state and behavior
//
. Document our code appropriately
//
. Reuse preexisting solutions as much as possible
//
. Share our code with others!

== Functions (Or Subroutines)

[quote]
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine[Function]:
//
a sequence of program instructions that perform a specific task, packaged as a
unit. This unit can then be used in programs wherever that particular task
should be performed.
____

[.s]
//
* In Java, a function takes _zero or more inputs_ and produces _no or one output_.
//
* Functions create a _block_ containing the imperative programming building
blocks we have already seen: variables, loops, conditional statements.

[[vrMmLkjEfsujbHoVyjzWIAbdDLQzDdKH]]
== Functions (Or Subroutines)

A good function:
//
[.s]
//
* **Does one thing well**
//
* **Can be easily tested**
//
* **Can be reused in multiple places**

[[tyrmxoGtViFOOACbFiqDBpgEhhmfxOTl]]
== Function Declaration

[source,java,role='small']
----
/**
 * Add two numbers together.
 *
 * @param firstNumber the first number to add
 * @param secondNumber the second number to add
 * @return the sum of the two numbers
 */
int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
----

[.s.small]
//
* In Java every function has a _name_, a list of _arguments_, a _return
type_,
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[_a Javadoc description_],
//
and a _return statement_.
//
* The *name* and *description are for you*, the programmer
//
* The *arguments* and *return type* are both for you and for Java
//
* The *Javadoc* is for you _and_ for others

[[hOiebdTyavDHVMcZmkojBrMZeABlFXjT]]
== Calling Functions

[.lead]
//
To _call_ a function we provide the arguments it requires and expect a result of
the type it is declared to return.

[.s]
//
* The code that calls the function is referred to as the _caller_.
//
* When a function is called, the caller waits until the function
returns
//
* The result can be saved, used like a literal of the
return type, or ignored

[[YZvTRZGcPWaZtWxjxrlSVmRLzCozyasQ]]
== `add` Example

[source,java,role='small']
----
/**
 * Add two numbers together.
 *
 * @param firstNumber the first number to add
 * @param secondNumber the second number to add
 * @return the sum of the two numbers
 */
int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
int result = add(3, 4);
System.out.println(add(4, 5));
int biggerResult = add(10, 20) + add(20, 30) + 10;
System.out.println(biggerResult);
add(6, 7); // This is dumb code but will compile and run
----

[[uArzOsQICgDsGEJnEiOtfLfyMwtRYWVz]]
== ! Add Two Numbers

[.janini.small]
....
// Ignore the extra static for now in our examples...
static int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
int result = add(3, 4);
System.out.println(add(4, 5));
int biggerResult = add(10, 20) + add(20, 30) + 10;
System.out.println(biggerResult);
add(6, 7); // This is dumb code but will compile and run
....

[[HfURoLPdmmuKEbHfnrzRlKJcbTPttYZE]]
== Good [.line-through]#Variable# Function Names

[.lead]
//
Just like variables, choosing good _function_ names
will make your life a lot easier as a programmer.

Good function names are:

[.s]
//
. Descriptive
//
. Indicative of the function's function&mdash;what it does
//
. As succinct as possible...
//
. But see #2 above

[[sPuYAsjxUtxNgZiMnUrKhLahWgUSvwTm]]
== Function Arguments

[.lead]
//
When a function begins executing the code has access to the variables declared
as arguments, which will contain the values passed by the caller.

You can think of these variables as pre-declared and pre-initialized.

[[WqnehuZUvbySXIyiIAJIecmtJfjBoORf]]
== `add` Example

[source,java,role='small']
----
/**
 * Add two numbers together.
 *
 * @param firstNumber the first number to add
 * @param secondNumber the second number to add
 * @return the sum of the two numbers
 */
int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  System.out.println(firstNumber);
  System.out.println(secondNumber);
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
System.out.println("Start");
int result = add(3, 4);

[[gflghmydtJybAJRsQIHkkTsoLnzRotAc]]
== ! Add Two Numbers

[.janini.small]
....
// Ignore the extra static for now in our examples...
static int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  System.out.println(firstNumber);
  System.out.println(secondNumber);
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}
System.out.println("Start");
int result = add(3, 4);
....

[[mXPpRQOkwFXdigorsNOAJvEuKGjvoPeq]]
== `return` and Return Type

[.lead]
//
A `return` statement _immediately exits the function_ and returns a result.

[.s]
//
* `return` statements can appear anywhere inside a function: inside a loop or
conditional statement
//
* A function can include multiple return statements
//
* Regardless of where they appear or how many are used, the function returns *as
soon as the first `return` statement is reached*
//
* A function _must return a value of the type it declared_

[[SARozugeSuiSZToETgfUqoaDOggJhFWF]]
== Javadoc Documentation

[.lead]
//
Good code requires documentation.
//
This is for the humans that use it.

In Java, we utilize the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc[Javadoc]
//
tool to turn comments into our code into structured online documentation.

That allows this:

[source,java,role='small']
----
/**
 * Example Javadoc.
 *
 * @param firstArgument first argument to my function
 * @return 0
 */
----

...to become this...

== Functions Frequently Implement Algorithms

[[pLsAYxUijeDaSSOvrgXIDlcYkerLyrfy]]
== Review: Algorithms

[quote]
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm[Algorithm]:
//
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
____

As computer scientists, we implement algorithms by having computers:

[.s]
//
* Perform simple calculations
//
* Store the results
//
* Make simple decisions
//
* Do things over and over again as fast as possible

[[JMPKZOQAATNOOYFKKITPXUWSBGHNCEFC]]
== Consecutive Identical Values

[.lead]
//
Given an array of chars, find all cases where consecutive elements are the same.

*First, what is our algorithm?*

[.s]
//
. Examine each value in the array
//
. Compare it with the next value&mdash;but how do we get at that?
//
. Print it out if they are the same

[[TVSNKHWSKTYCIKSALIZGDIBDCSNSRHWO]]
== ! Consecutive Identical Characters

[.janini.small]
....
// Print when consecutive characters are identical
char[] characters = { 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'c', 'c' };
....

[[seahIvZqeZfisdiuUeXeTCwkShCfpdjt]]
== Average Of An Array

[.lead]
//
Given an array of doubles, average the values that it contains.

*First, what is our algorithm?*

[.s]
//
* Note that this is really just a variant of an earlier problem: array _sum_.

[[DeBkVXtGAHkAKJinIoqPFkMcDhiJATxo]]
== ! Average Of An Array
[.janini]
....
// Compute the average
double[] toAverage = { 0.1, 6.7, 8.9, 10.4, 11.2, 0.9 };
....

== MP0

[.lead]
//
MP0 will be released today. It's our first Android MP of this semester.

[.s.small]
//
* Some of you are going to sit down today with MP0 and _freak out_.
//
* Please try to stay calm! Our MPs can be intimating at first, but with time and
help from the course staff you'll get your head around it.
//
* You'll have a chance to get started on MP0 in lab this week, and we encourage
you to come to office hours as well.
//
* MP0 _does_ toss you into the deep end of Android app development.
//
*This is intentional.*
//
Working your way through large unfamiliar pieces of code is as much an important
computer science skill as solving small problems like our homework.

== Questions?

[[OBLbAkJElAJAKOCSqyEIEFgKyaPMwouY]]
== Announcements

[.small]
//
* Daily homework continues _today_.
//
* Quiz 2 will cover everything up through _today_, including some
multiple-choice questions on functions.
//
* A gentle reminder that there is extra credit available for reliably reading
forum announcements.
//
* I will hold office hours today in *Siebel 0403*, not in Siebel 2227.
//
(But I'm putting the finishing touches on MP0 so I may ask you to talk to
another staff member.)
//
* MP0 will be released today at 5PM and due in _one week_.
//
Please get started as soon as the assignment is released!
//
Note that there are 10 points on MP0 for earning 30 points by *5PM on Friday.*
