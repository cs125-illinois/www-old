//
. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. Storing data
//
. And communicating

//

//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast

. Communicating... well maybe you're OK at that footnote:[Not all computer
scientists are...].

[.s]*All things you _aren't_ good at!*

*Together you can solve any problem.*

[[ewZnhvFaDvLRFqtxGvxMDYXmyMBcigzt]]
== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

[[RAnQjIUlgLetUIYHXrFketYnumiEsMhC]]
== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

[[CrGzONxvmobDiCzYtqUUZBrkSdXFTmsK]]
== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies
//
* *Android programming*: working with large, complex, and unfamiliar programming
environments

[[FYXOUkfcCLrPKUjFqEYcvaKpyIwhHLBe]]
== Don't Tell Anyone: Programming Is Fun

[.s]
//
* *Really fun.* It's an ultimate mental challenge and a full left-right brain
workout.
//
* Once you get good at it, it'll be one of your favorite things to do.
//
And you can change the world. So there's that.

[[onGoAtMItLsYctSxAvdkkXunzesajYla]]
== Creations

Computer scientists have built some incredible things!
//
So we'll try to find time to talk about things like:

* The internet
//
* Google
//
* Computer hardware
//
* Artificial intelligence
//
* And something that you might suggest! We're open to ideas.

== How CS 125 Works

[.lead]
//
Roughly the course material is broken down into two parts:

* *Lectures, quizzes, and homework* cover core programming concepts.
//
* *Labs and MPs* provide practice with working on larger software projects.

[[ouQsRSTMLTlEBGfWyBNFjPItAQsbQjFQ]]
== Lectures

[.s]
//
* Lectures are taught in an active learning style. We'll spend our time reading
and writing code together, just like the examples we started class with.
//
* If you have a laptop, *bring it with you*. If you don't, we'll make
accommodations.
//
* You'll receive credit for being in the right place at the right time and
following along and participating
//
* I will start promptly at 10AM and go until 10:50AM.
//
You will get your money's worth.
//
* There will be excellent footnote:[you may find it excellent] and loud
footnote:[definitely] music beforehand if you need help waking up.

== Together in Lincoln Theater

This is a beautiful hall, but there are a bunch of us here together.

[[HYQROHZQKCRBMZTJWXQIMELPCMWZMDKX]]
== Making Lincoln Work

[.s]
//
* *Please arrive early so that you can get a seat.*
//
* *Please bring a fully-charged laptop.* (Even Siebel 1404 doesn't have
chargers...)
//
* *Please be gentle with the WiFi.* Our in-class activities are more important
than whatever soccer match happens to be on now.

[[cOHlQcYpxtJTpTzbPIlINKtGFgMBZuMk]]
== Homework

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* Our CS 125 homework problems are the primary way that you learn the material.
//
* One per day from now until May.
//
* Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

[[MyXRvFcBdNgnxuoEepndfhaeXBLKnQvC]]
== Quizzes

[.lead]
//
CS 125 gives weekly assessments in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility]

[.s]
//
* 12 weekly assessments will be quizzes, 3 will be midterms
//
* All quizzes and midterms are worth the same, but midterms are more cumulative
and cannot be dropped
//
* Every quiz and midterm contains programming problems
//
* **The point of these assessments is to get you to do the homework**

[[adGMBnUChHWdnfpipELPnKidamOieddU]]
== Labs and MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about (more) practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* Our CS 125 Android programming assignments&mdash;known here as
_machine problems_&mdash;are _another_ enormous part of how you learn the
material.
//
* Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.
//
* Lab this semester will also cover Android programming and other related
topics.

[[xodQblWATMrtMunenwmvdsidYDeiHePj]]
== CS 125 Course Design Principles

[.lead]
//
Programming is about consistent, regular practice. Period.
//
The course is designed with this in mind.

[.s]
//
* There are no high-percentage exams in CS 125
//
* You'll do a bit _each_ and _every_ day
//
* Good news: no cramming, no high-stakes assessments
//
* Bad news: no way to save yourself if you get behind
//
* **So don't**

//
* 406,028 failed test cases and 247,970 successful ones
//
* 711,429 added or modified lines of code footnote:[not including the final project]
//

[.s]
//

== Who's Not a Beginner?

[[hptvBcPwwAHmrXIznsTSPLRlWaaHmBdV]]
== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...

[[ieEYXAwbaNJUaEBgXOYZFrmXIZHeRaki]]
== How To Succeed in CS 125

[.s]
//
. Prepare for, attend, and participate in your assigned lecture and lab section
//
. Do your daily homework problems
//
. Start the MPs early and make a regular appointment to come to office hours
//
. Don't miss the weekly quizzes in the CBTF&mdash;they start _tomorrow_

== Cheating

[.lead]
//
I take academic integrity extremely seriously.
//
Cheaters will be caught and punished.

[[ZSEOLRHBUIIFONSDYHUUYEWHRPCHPSBS]]
== Week 0

[.s.small]
//
* *Today*: I'll hang around outside Lincoln until noon and then be back in
Siebel 0403 (our basement space) from 1&ndash;4PM.
//
Please stop by to say hi or if you have any questions.
//
* *Today*: Our https://goo.gl/CtUc98[first homework problem has been posted].

It's easy, but our goal is for you to be programming every day from now until
May.
//
* *Tomorrow*: Quizzes and labs start. Both are important! And more homework!
//
* *Wednesday*: We'll keep learning to program. And more homework!
//
