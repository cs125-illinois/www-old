== Algorithms

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm[Algorithm]:
//
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
//
____

As computer scientists, we implement algorithms by having computers:

[.s]
//
* Perform simple calculations
//
* Store the results
//
* Make simple decisions
//
* Do things over and over again as fast as possible

[[JGTmnbkHwboAihJynfxUiXyvQBMcEFus]]
== Data Structures

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure[Data structure]:
//
a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or
operations that can be applied to the data.
//
____

As Java programmers we implement more complicated data structures using a mix
of:

[.s]
//
* Primitive types and objects to _store_ and organize data values
//
* Existing data structures like arrays
//
* References to reflect relationships among objects

[[YumtfuKBaLhokozilRqGVVRzrwypGfOd]]
== Algorithms and Data Structures

[.lead]
//
Algorithms and data structures are _highly complementary_:

[.s]
//
* We will implement algorithms that utilize specific features of data structures
//
* We will implement data structures to support specific algorithms
//
* We will use our existing imperative and object-oriented ideas along the way
//
* And we'll introduce a few more important ideas along the way

== Algorithm Analysis

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms[Algorithm analysis]:
//
the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the
amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.
//
____

== At The Limit

[.lead]
//
We're usually want to analyze an algorithm in the general case, rather than for
a specific set of input.

[.s]
//
* How does the algorithm perform on arbitrarily difficult or large inputs?
//
* What are the best, average, and worst-case running times?
//
* *How is the algorithm's performance related to its inputs?*

== Big-O Notation

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Product[Big-O notation]
//
is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
//
____

Put another way: we want to _estimate_ what happens as the problem gets really,
really hard.

== O(1)

[source,java]

int[] myArray = new int[1024];
int getArrayValue = myArray[10]; // This is constant time

[.lead]
//
O(1) is sometimes called constant time.

Life is good and livin' is easy. But we're usually not this lucky.

== O(n)

[source,java]
----
int[] myArray = new int[1024];
int sum = 0;
// A single loop through an array is usually O(n)
for (int arrayValue : myArray) {
  sum += arrayValue;
}
----

[.lead]
//
O(n) is still not bad.

Frequently we have to see each value in an array or other data structure at
least once, so sometimes O(n) is the best we can do.

//
Now things are getting bad.

[.s]
//
* If we need to both loop through an array _and_ compare every element with every
other element we end up with an O(n^2) algorithm.
//
* You can identify it by the nested loops.

== O(log n) and O(n log n)

[.lead]
//
The logarithmic growth rates are usually caused by features of problems that we
haven't seen yet&mdash;but will soon.

[.s]
//
* If every step of the algorithm makes cut the size of the problem _in half_,
then you end up with a O(log n) runtime.
//
* Recursive algorithms frequently have this property.

== Dumb Algorithm, Clever Algorithm

[.s.lead]
//
A *dumb* algorithm can move a problem _up_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n) to O(n^2). (Our sort test is dumb. The problem is O(n).)

[.s.lead]
//
A *smart* algorithm can move a problem _down_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n^2) to O(n log n). (Euclid's Method GCD is smart. The problem
is O(log(N)).)

== (An Annoying Aside on Java Primitive Object Wrappers)

[.lead]
//
In Java, certain data structures (`Maps`, `ArrayLists`, etc.) only operate on
_objects_. (Because `Object` provides `hashCode`.)

But then how do we insert primitive types (`ints`, `longs`, etc.) into them?

[source,java,role='s small']
----
Integer imAnObject = new Integer(5);
imAnObject = (Integer) 5; // You can cast primitives to object wrapper
int imNotAnObject = (int) imAnObject; // And back

== Lists

[.lead]
//
What you will be building on the next few homework problems is a general
data structure called a _list_.

Lists are an _ordered_ footnote:[We'll talk about unordered soon...] data structure that allow us to:

[.s]
//
* Get and set values at any index (like an array)
//
* Add or remove values at any index (this is new)
//
* Lists are one of the two data structures you meet in heaven&mdash;maps are the
other and we'll get to them in a few weeks

[[ZNOikwniBxwwdnfIrXpGZeDunUmkcdRQ]]
== Data Structure Tradeoffs

[.lead]
//
Depending on how we structure data different implementations of the _same_
interface can have different performance characteristics.

[.s]
//
* We'll start by looking at this with _lists_
//
* Lists that store items using arrays have *fast* (O(1)) lookups but _slow_
(O(n)) modifications
//
* Lists that store items using linked lists have _slow_ lookups (O(n)) but some
insertions are *fast* (O(1))
//
* Both also present different memory usage tradeoffs
