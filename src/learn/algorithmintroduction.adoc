== Algorithms

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm[Algorithm]:
//
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other
problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
//
____

As computer scientists, we implement algorithms by having computers:

[.s]
//
* Perform simple calculations
//
* Store the results
//
* Make simple decisions
//
* Do things over and over again as fast as possible

[[JGTmnbkHwboAihJynfxUiXyvQBMcEFus]]
== Data Structures

[quote]
//
____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure[Data structure]:
//
a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or
operations that can be applied to the data.
//
____

As Java programmers we implement more complicated data structures using a mix
of:

[.s]
//
* Primitive types and objects to _store_ and organize data values
//
* Existing data structures like arrays
//
* References to reflect relationships among objects

[[YumtfuKBaLhokozilRqGVVRzrwypGfOd]]
== Algorithms and Data Structures

[.lead]
//
Algorithms and data structures are _highly complementary_:

[.s]
//
* We will implement algorithms that utilize specific features of data structures
//
* We will implement data structures to support specific algorithms
//
* We will use our existing imperative and object-oriented ideas along the way
//
* And we'll introduce a few more important ideas along the way

== Example: Greatest Common Denominator

[quote]
//
____
//
In mathematics, the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor[greatest common divisor
(GCD)]
//
of two or more integers, which are not all zero, is the largest positive integer
that divides each of the integers.

What's a simpler approach?

== Brute Force Solution

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search[Brute force solution]:
//
a very general problem-solving technique that consists of systematically
enumerating all possible candidates for the solution and checking whether each
candidate satisfies the problem's statement.
//
____

[.s]
//
* Computers today are very, _very_ fast
//
* So try the simple thing first
//
* If it's too slow, try something a bit more sophisticated

== You Don't Need the Fastest Algorithm to Change the World

That's a good thing!

[[KTGrHQJiStmgrdjVjvLJBvdHTokGvbGK]]
== But Speed Eventually Matters

[.lead]
//
Even if you don't at the beginning, you will eventually start to care about how
fast your code runs.
//
For any number of the following reasons:

[.s]
//
* You start to have larger problems to solve.
//
* You're embarrassed that your algorithm makes your incredibly fast computer
seem slow
//
* You have to start paying for machines
//
* Your customer tells you that your program is too slow
//
* You're in a job interview

[[XIAanwdDVyALfCEgZLNQljuMKfylgtld]]
== So How Long Will It Take?

[.lead]
//
How long will our brute force GCD algorithm take?

[.s]
//
* To compute the GCD of 4 and 6
//
* To compute the GCD of 185 and 2045
//
* To compute the GCD of M and N

[[UgJrBAbxmpaEtUFaigwcjbLnlTfcIOoF]]
== Algorithm Analysis

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms[Algorithm analysis]:
//
the determination of the computational complexity of algorithms, that is the
amount of time, storage and/or other resources necessary to execute them.
//
____

[[bzGJKlpimKGIHSRpMdozAZQHDQCfHegP]]
== At The Limit

[.lead]
//
We're usually want to analyze an algorithm in the general case, rather than for
a specific set of inputs.

[.s]
//
* How does the algorithm perform on arbitrarily difficult or large inputs?
//
* What are the best, average, and worst-case running times?
//
* *How is the algorithm's performance related to its inputs?*

[[wZpYuIQdhBkDdYLdffvSWUUvbhDCqzoG]]
== Big-O Notation

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation#Product[Big-O notation]
//
is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function
when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
//
____

[.lead]
//
Put another way: we want to _estimate_ what happens as the problem gets really,
really hard.

(At this point non-critical components of the algorithm's performance also cease
to matter.)

== O(1)

[source,java]
----
int[] myArray = new int[1024];
int getArrayValue = myArray[10]; // This is constant time
----

[.lead]
//
O(1) is sometimes called constant time.

Life is good and livin' is easy. But we're usually not this lucky.

[[KUmETESzjfZHSFyAINSsXaxeFQsVuVJm]]
== O(n)

[source,java]
----
int[] myArray = new int[1024];
int sum = 0;
// A single loop through an array is usually O(n)
for (int arrayValue : myArray) {
  sum += arrayValue;
}
----

[.lead]
//
O(n) is still not bad.

Frequently we have to see each value in an array or other data structure at
least once, so sometimes O(n) is the best we can do.

What about the example above?

[.s]
//
* *Best case*: [.s]#it's the _first_ element#
//
* *Worst case*: [.s]#it's the _last_ element#
//
* *Average case*: [.s]#O(n / 2), which we usually simplify to just O(n)#

  }

}
----

[.lead]
//
Now things are getting bad.

[.s]
//
* If we need to both loop through an array _and_ compare every element with every
other element we end up with an O(n^2) algorithm.
//
* You can identify it by the nested loops.

== O(log n) and O(n log n)

[.lead]
//
The logarithmic growth rates are usually caused by features of problems that we
haven't seen yet&mdash;but will soon.

[.s]
//
* If every step of the algorithm makes cut the size of the problem _in half_,
then you end up with a O(log n) runtime.
//
* Recursive algorithms frequently have this property.

[[efsgaXBTFHpEdxGrToSwqgJExyuqqvqN]]
== Dumb Algorithm, Clever Algorithm

[.s.lead]
//
A *dumb* algorithm can move a problem _up_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n) to O(n^2). (Our sort test is dumb. The problem is O(n).)

[.s.lead]
//
A *smart* algorithm can move a problem _down_ in the runtime categorization: for
example, from O(n^2) to O(n log n). (Euclid's Method GCD is smart. The problem
is O(log(N)).)
