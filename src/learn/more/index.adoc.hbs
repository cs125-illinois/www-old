The internet is full of information, and _particularly_ full of information
about computer science.
//
We will not actively curate a list of online resources here
//
footnote:[except when asked very politely and persistently],
//
since Google is by far the best way to find out more.
//
But what follows are a few examples of high-quality materials that may help you
learn Java.

This list is just the tip of the iceberg, but it should make it clear that _if
you want to learn Java, you can_.
//
We're hear to provide help and inspiration along the way.

[[learning]]
== Learning

* Oracle maintains what must be considered to be the
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/[definitive online Java tutorial].
//
Bookmark it&mdash;it's excellent.
//
* http://www.learnjavaonline.org/[Learn Java Online] provides an interactive
web-based learning experience specifically tailored to Java.
//
* *https://www.coursera.org/[Coursera]* also has many
https://www.coursera.org/courses?languages=en&query=java[Java-based courses]
from a variety of excellent universities.
//
https://www.edx.org/[EdX] and https://www.udacity.com[Udacity] do as well.

[[practice]]
== Practice

* The online programming practice site https://www.hackerrank.com/[HackerRank]
has a https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java/java-introduction[series of
introductory Java questions]
//
* Many other coding competition sites exist, including
//
https://goo.gl/mYJ9Yv[TopCoder],
//
https://leetcode.com/[LeetCode],
//
and
//
https://goo.gl/6DRmJY[many more].
//
* *https://www.codecademy.com/[Codecademy]* has great interactive online
tutorials about many programming languages, including
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java[Java].
//
* http://codingbat.com/java[CodingBat] has a free set of introductory Java
exercises

[[playgrounds]]
== Playgrounds

* Our
//
link:/learn/[online slides]
//
provide embedded editable examples that use our own homegrown playground called
//
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/jeed[Jeed].
//
* But other online Java playgrounds exist, including
//
https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler[JDoodle].

[[textbook]]
== Textbooks

In the past CS 125 assigned readings from the comprehensive and free online
textbook
//
http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/[Introduction to Programming Using Java, Seventh
Edition],
//
by
//
http://math.hws.edu/eck/[David J. Eck]
//
of
//
http://www2.hws.edu/[Hobart and William Smith Colleges].
//
This textbook is available in several formats, including as a
//
http://math.hws.edu/eck/cs124/downloads/javanotes7-linked.pdf[PDF].
//
There are also examples programs included&mdash;see the
