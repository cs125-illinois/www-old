[[LtWPIPeLHfUwKfLHnFsAgObQiACAUHXo]]
== What Are Computers Good At?

[.s]
//
. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. Storing data
//
. And communicating

[[trPWFBOyXxoIyQwoOOXVARxRbDjgTDiV]]
== !Basic Math

[.janini]
....
// Computers can do basic math
int x = 5;
int y = 6;
System.out.println(x + y);
int z = x + y + 1;
System.out.println(z);
....

== !Simple Decision Making

....
// Computers can make simple decisions
int temperature =
if (temperature >= 80 && temperature <= 95) {
  System.out.print("It's hot");
} else if (temperature > 95) {
  System.out.println("It's really hot");
}

== What Are Computers Good At?

. Basic math
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. Communicating... well maybe you're OK at that footnote:[Not all computer
scientists are...].

*All things you _aren't_ good at!*

[[kMaCiQgHeLOyOtAyLWujkhWPQqGiyezT]]
== Your Perfect Complement

[.lead]
//
*Together you can solve any problem.*

[[ewZnhvFaDvLRFqtxGvxMDYXmyMBcigzt]]
== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

[[RAnQjIUlgLetUIYHXrFketYnumiEsMhC]]
== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

[[CrGzONxvmobDiCzYtqUUZBrkSdXFTmsK]]
== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies

[[FYXOUkfcCLrPKUjFqEYcvaKpyIwhHLBe]]
== Don't Tell Anyone: Programming Is Fun

[.s]
//
* *Really fun.* It's an ultimate mental challenge and a full left-right brain
workout.
//
* Once you get good at it, it'll be one of your favorite things to do.
//
And you can change the world. So there's that.

[[onGoAtMItLsYctSxAvdkkXunzesajYla]]
== Creations

Computer scientists have built some incredible things!
//
So we'll try to find time to talk about things like:

* The internet
//
* Google
//
* Computer hardware
//
* Artificial intelligence
//
* And something that you might suggest! We're open to ideas.

== Lectures

[.s]
//
* Lectures are taught in an active learning style. We'll spend our time reading
and writing code together, just like the examples we started class with.
//
* If you have a laptop, *bring it with you*. If you don't, we'll make
accommodations.
//
* You'll receive credit for being in the right place at the right time and
following along and participating
//
* I will start promptly at 9AM and go until 9:50AM.
//
You will get your money's worth.
//
* There will be excellent and loud music beforehand if you need help waking up.

== Together in Foellinger

This is a beautiful hall, but there are a bunch of us here together.

[[HYQROHZQKCRBMZTJWXQIMELPCMWZMDKX]]
== Making Foellinger Work

[.s]
//
* *Please arrive early so that you can get a seat.*
//
* *Please bring a fully-charged laptop.* (Even Siebel 1404 doesn't have
chargers...)
//
* *Please be gentle with the WiFi.* Our in-class activities are more important
than whatever soccer match happens to be on now.

[[cOHlQcYpxtJTpTzbPIlINKtGFgMBZuMk]]
== MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

The programming assignments&mdash;known at CS@Illinois as _machine
problems_&mdash;are an enormous part of how you learn the material.
//
Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

[[hptvBcPwwAHmrXIznsTSPLRlWaaHmBdV]]
== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...

[[ieEYXAwbaNJUaEBgXOYZFrmXIZHeRaki]]
== How To Succeed in CS 125

[.s]
//
. Prepare for, attend, and participate in your assigned lecture and lab section
//
. Do your daily homework problems
//
. Start the MPs early and make a regular appointment to come to office hours
//
. Don't miss the weekly quizzes in the CBTF&mdash;they start _tomorrow_

[[ZSEOLRHBUIIFONSDYHUUYEWHRPCHPSBS]]
== Week 0

[.s.small]
//
* *Today*: I'll be in Siebel 2227 starting after lecture until around 12:30.
//
Please stop by to say hi or if you have any questions.
//
* *Today*: Our https://goo.gl/ruqwbf[first homework problem has been posted].
It's easy, but our goal is for you to be programming every day from now until
December.
//
* *Tomorrow*: Quizzes and labs start. Both are important! And more homework!
//
* *Wednesday*: we'll keep learning to program. And more homework!
//
* *Thursdays*: by Thursday everything about the class should be working
footnote:[Yeah, right.] And more homework!
//
* *Friday*: we'll keep learning to program and our first MP will be released.
[.s]#And more homework!#

//
* Labs start _tomorrow_ and the first one includes important setup
//
* Quizzes start _tomorrow_, but the first quiz is easy and mainly covers course
