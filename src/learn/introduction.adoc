[[ewZnhvFaDvLRFqtxGvxMDYXmyMBcigzt]]
== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

[[RAnQjIUlgLetUIYHXrFketYnumiEsMhC]]
== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

[[CrGzONxvmobDiCzYtqUUZBrkSdXFTmsK]]
== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies
//
* *Android programming*: working with large, complex, and unfamiliar programming
environments

[[FYXOUkfcCLrPKUjFqEYcvaKpyIwhHLBe]]
== Don't Tell Anyone: Programming Is Fun

[.s]
//
* *Really fun.* It's an ultimate mental challenge and a full left-right brain
workout.
//
* Once you get good at it, it'll be one of your favorite things to do.
//
And you can change the world. So there's that.

[[onGoAtMItLsYctSxAvdkkXunzesajYla]]
== Creations

Computer scientists have built some incredible things!
//
So we'll try to find time to talk about things like:

* The internet
//
* Google
//
* Computer hardware
//
* Artificial intelligence
//
* And something that you might suggest! We're open to ideas.

== How CS 125 Works

[.lead]
//
Roughly the course material is broken down into two parts:

* *Lectures, quizzes, and homework* cover core programming concepts.
//
* *Labs and the Machine Project* provide practice with working on larger software projects.
//
* We're also reading a _book_ this semester to help introduce you to the culture
of technology.

[[ouQsRSTMLTlEBGfWyBNFjPItAQsbQjFQ]]
== Lectures

[.s]
//
* Lectures are taught in an active learning style. We'll spend our time reading
and writing code together, just like the examples we started class with.
//
* If you have a laptop, *bring it with you*. If you don't, we'll make
accommodations.
//
* You'll receive credit for being in the right place at the right time and
following along and participating
//
* I will start promptly at 11AM and go until 11:50AM.
//
You will get your money's worth.
//
* There will be excellent footnote:[you may find it excellent] and loud
footnote:[definitely] music beforehand if you need help waking up.

== Together in Foellinger Auditorium

This is a beautiful place, but there are a bunch of us here together.

[[HYQROHZQKCRBMZTJWXQIMELPCMWZMDKX]]
== Making Foellinger Work

[.s]
//
* *Please arrive early so that you can get a seat.*
//
* *Please bring a fully-charged laptop.* (Even Siebel 1404 doesn't have
chargers...)
//
* *Please be gentle with the WiFi.* Our in-class activities are more important
than whatever soccer match happens to be on now.

[[cOHlQcYpxtJTpTzbPIlINKtGFgMBZuMk]]
== Homework

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* Our CS 125 homework problems are the primary way that you learn the material.
//
* One per day from now until December.
//
* Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

[[MyXRvFcBdNgnxuoEepndfhaeXBLKnQvC]]
== Quizzes

[.lead]
//
CS 125 gives weekly assessments in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility]

[.s]
//
* 12 weekly assessments will be quizzes, 3 will be midterms
//
* All quizzes and midterms are worth the same, but midterms are more cumulative
and cannot be dropped
//
* Every quiz and midterm contains programming problems
//
* **The point of these assessments is to get you to do the homework**

[[adGMBnUChHWdnfpipELPnKidamOieddU]]
== Labs and MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about (more) practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* This semester we're moving to a single long multi-part machine _project_ that
will span the entire semester.
//
You'll be building a cool Android app in stages calibrated to help you learn.
//
* Start each MP checkpoint early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The
more you work at them, the more you learn.
//
* Lab this semester will also cover Android programming and other related
topics.

This is a fantastic book&mdash;you will enjoy it and learn a lot from it.
(A few questions about it will be on each quiz.)

[[xodQblWATMrtMunenwmvdsidYDeiHePj]]
== CS 125 Course Design Principles

[.lead]
//
Programming is about consistent, regular practice. Period.
//
The course is designed with this in mind.

[.s]
//
* There are no high-percentage exams in CS 125
//
* You'll do a bit _each_ and _every_ day
//
* Good news: no cramming, no high-stakes assessments
//
* Bad news: no way to save yourself if you get behind
//
* **So don't**

== !Up And To The Right

== Quantity v. Quality

[quote,role='small']
____
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class
into two groups.
//
All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be
graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right
solely on its quality.
//
His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he
would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group:
fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on.
//
Those being
graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect
one - to get an "A".

**Well, come grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality
were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.**
//
It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of
work&mdash;and learning from their mistakes&mdash;the "quality" group had sat
theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their
efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

[.s]
//
* 160 homework and exam programming problems
//
* 8,789 lines of testing code
//
* 23,379 _hours_ of work on the homework problems, including 5,672 on the
ungraded practice problems
//
* 588,765 submissions on the lab, quiz, exam, and homework programming problems...
//
* ...containing _10,718,190_ (!!!) lines of non-commenting code!
//
* Which is roughly 20,000 lines of code per student (!!!).

[[ffoCTGqmPdHdXDxhAjUEffhCnULparbd]]
== Spring 2019 Homework

[.s.small]
//
* 588,765 programming problem submissions, resulting in...
//
* 95,721 `checkstyle` errors,
//
* 221,039 compilation errors,
//
* 178,837 testing errors,
//
* leaving 93,168 correct submissions.
//
* Of which _11,603_ were *perfect*.

== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...
