[[ewZnhvFaDvLRFqtxGvxMDYXmyMBcigzt]]
== Concept and Craft

[.lead]
//
Computer science is both a _conceptual_ and an _applied_ discipline.

[.s]
//
* *Concepts*: computer science has deep roots in mathematics and explores the
fundamental heart of problem solving
//
* *Craft*: as you learn computer science, you learn the most powerful skill on
Earth: programming.

[[RAnQjIUlgLetUIYHXrFketYnumiEsMhC]]
== Concepts

[.s]
//
* *Algorithms*: ways of solving problems and what makes certain problems hard
//
* *Representation*: representing data so that computers can manipulate it
//
* *Recursion*: breaking down problems into smaller, manageable pieces

[[CrGzONxvmobDiCzYtqUUZBrkSdXFTmsK]]
== Craft

[.s]
//
* *Imperative programming*: solving problems using constructs like
loops and conditional expressions
//
* *Object-oriented programming*: design patterns for starting to work on larger
software projects
//
* *Software development*: design, style, debugging, testing, and other core
software development competencies
//
* *Android programming*: working with large, complex, and unfamiliar programming
environments

[[FYXOUkfcCLrPKUjFqEYcvaKpyIwhHLBe]]
== Don't Tell Anyone: Programming Is Fun

[.s]
//
* *Really fun.* It's an ultimate mental challenge and a full left-right brain
workout.
//
* Once you get good at it, it'll be one of your favorite things to do.
//
And you can change the world. So there's that.

[[onGoAtMItLsYctSxAvdkkXunzesajYla]]
== Creations

Computer scientists have built some incredible things!
//
So we'll try to find time to talk about things like:

* The internet
//
* Google
//
* Computer hardware
//
* Artificial intelligence
//
* And something that you might suggest! We're open to ideas.

== How CS 125 Works

[.lead]
//
Roughly the course material is broken down into two parts:

* *Classes, quizzes, and homework* cover core programming concepts.
//
* *Labs and the Machine Project* provide practice with working on larger software projects.
//
* We're also reading a _book_ to help introduce you to the culture
of technology.

[[ouQsRSTMLTlEBGfWyBNFjPItAQsbQjFQ]]
== Class

[.s]
//
* Class is taught in an active learning style. We'll spend our time reading
and writing code together, just like the examples we started class with.
//
* If you have a laptop, *bring it with you*. If you don't, we'll make
accommodations.
//
* You'll receive credit for being in the right place at the right time and
following along and participating
//
* I will start promptly at 10AM and go until 10:50AM.
//
You will get your money's worth.
//
* There will be excellent footnote:[you may find it excellent] and loud
footnote:[definitely] music beforehand if you need help waking up.

== Together in Lincoln Theater

This is a beautiful place, but there are a bunch of us here together.

[[HYQROHZQKCRBMZTJWXQIMELPCMWZMDKX]]
== Making Lincoln Work

[.s]
//
* *Please arrive early so that you can get a seat.*
//
* *Please bring a fully-charged laptop.* (Even Siebel 1404 doesn't have
chargers...)
//
* *Please be gentle with the WiFi.* Our in-class activities are more important
than whatever soccer match happens to be on now.

[[cOHlQcYpxtJTpTzbPIlINKtGFgMBZuMk]]
== Homework

[.lead]
//
Programming is about practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* Our CS 125 homework problems are the primary way that you learn the material.
//
* One per day from now until May.
//
* Start them early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The more you work at
them, the more you learn.

[[MyXRvFcBdNgnxuoEepndfhaeXBLKnQvC]]
== Quizzes

[.lead]
//
CS 125 gives weekly assessments in the
//
https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[Computer-Based Testing Facility]

[.s]
//
* 12 weekly assessments will be quizzes, 3 will be midterms
//
* All quizzes and midterms are worth the same, but midterms are more cumulative
and cannot be dropped
//
* Every quiz and midterm contains programming problems
//
* **The point of these assessments is to get you to do the homework**

== Let Me Love on the CBTF

//
List of schools that give weekly computerized exams in CS1 in a controlled
environment:

* The University of Illinois
//
* ...?
//
* ...Anyone?
//
* You may come to hate and fear the https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu[CBTF]
footnote:[I don't go in there... too much bad juju.], but it _will_ help you learn.

[[adGMBnUChHWdnfpipELPnKidamOieddU]]
== Labs and MPs

[.lead]
//
Programming is about (more) practice. Period.

[.s]
//
* This semester we're moving to a single long multi-part machine _project_ that
will span the entire semester.
//
You'll be building a cool Android app in stages calibrated to help you learn.
//
* Start each MP checkpoint early, get help as needed, and don't give up! The
more you work at them, the more you learn.
//
* Lab this semester will also cover Android programming and other related
topics.

This is a fantastic book&mdash;you will enjoy it and learn a lot from it.
(A few questions about it will be on each quiz.)

== CS 125 Course Design Principles

[.lead]
//
Programming is about consistent, regular practice. Period.
//
The course is designed with this in mind.

[.s]
//
* There are no high-percentage exams in CS 125
//
* You'll do a bit _each_ and _every_ day
//
* Good news: no cramming, no high-stakes assessments
//
* Bad news: no way to save yourself if you get behind
//
* **So don't**

[[bVbLiSlqHiEiEfcnjldCjqeMJHpmNyqO]]
== Fall 2019 Homework

[.s]
//
* 167 homework and exam programming problems
//
* 8,789 lines of testing code
//
* 30,541 _hours_ of work on the homework problems, including 6,484 on the
ungraded practice problems
//
* 802,458 submissions on the lab, quiz, exam, and homework programming problems...
//
* ...containing _15,066,257_ (!!!) lines of non-commenting code!
//
* Which is roughly 21,500 lines of code per student (!!!).

[[OICwIzuykbRZmoRiZJlNBdAYudAFjaSB]]
== Fall 2019 Homework

And the bugs. Oh, the bugs...

[.s.small]
//
* 802,458  programming problem submissions, resulting in...
//
* 133,965 `checkstyle` errors,
//
* 274,434 compilation errors,
//
* 264,126  testing errors,
//
* leaving 129,933 correct submissions.

== Beginner's Rule

[.s]
* Many of you are beginners, but not all of you.
//
* If you're new and you meet someone that seems much better than you&mdash;they
have probably just had more practice.

* Don't get discouraged!
//
*But the only way to catch up is to keep practicing.*
//
* You _will_ get better. And it gets fun _fast_...

== How To Succeed in CS 125

[.s]
//
. Prepare for, attend, and participate in your assigned lecture and lab section
//
. Do your daily homework problems
//
. Start the MPs early and make a regular appointment to come to office hours
//
. Don't miss the weekly quizzes in the CBTF&mdash;they start _tomorrow_
//
. **Use the https://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/join/[course forum]!**

[[ZSEOLRHBUIIFONSDYHUUYEWHRPCHPSBS]]
== Week 0

[.s.small]
//
* *Today*: I'll hang around outside Lincoln until 12PM and then be back in
Siebel 2227 (my office) from 3&ndash;5PM.
//
Please stop by to say hi or if you have any questions.
//
* *Monday*: our first homework problem was released.
//
* *Yesterday*: Labs and our first quiz started.
//
* *Today*: Our
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/52292/assessments[_third_ homework problem has been posted].
//
It's easy, but our goal is for you to be programming every day from now until
May.
//
* *Thursdays*: More homework
//
* *Friday*: We'll keep learning to program... [.s]#and more homework!#

[[BcmhYkxckAKoaWAQxWnZXqbxDHdnfxnL]]
== Weeks 0 and 1

[.lead]
//
This semester starts on a Wednesday, so things are going to be a bit
out-of-order initially.

[.s]
//
* For the first two weeks homework will be released daily but **not due until
Sunday 2/2/2020.**
//
* Some homework may be released before we cover the concept in class. Feel free
to give them a try, or just wait until we get to the concept in class.
//
* After two weeks everything will straighten itself out.
