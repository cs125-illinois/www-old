**Don't be a computer.**

**Be _not_ a computer.**

[.s]

* If a computer can do it, it's not uniquely human.
//
* Try to emphasize your human qualities when interacting with
others&mdash;especially with computer scientists.

[.lead]
//
**That's entirely my fault, and I apologize.**

[.s]
//
* When we try new things we sometimes have to make adjustments, and probably
should have made this one sooner.
//
* It's also been putting a huge amount of stress on the course staff, who have
been handling things extremely well.
//
* And you're also all doing quite well, despite the increased difficulty level.

Here's what we're going to do.

[.s]
//
. We're adjusting the length and difficulty level of the remaining parts of the
MP
//
. **We've also provided everyone with 1 MP checkpoint drop.** (The grades page
is up-to-date as of this morning.)
//
. The midterm grades that went out over the weekend _do not_ include this
change.

____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_(computer_science)[Reference:]
//
a value that enables a program to _indirectly_ access a particular datum, such
as a variable's value or a record, in the computer's memory or in some other
storage device.
//
The reference is said to refer to the datum, and accessing the datum is called
dereferencing the reference.

== Review: References Are Not Objects

[.lead]
//
References _are not_ the thing the refer to.

Some real-world references include:

* *A phone number*: which refers to a phone
//
* *A street address*: which refers to a physical location
//
* *A social security number*: which refers to a person

[[itfuafekfLjAzwwbVrkStPQVIGyxObCF]]
== Review: Copying References

[.lead]
//
Copying a reference _does not_ copy the object it refers to.

[.s]
//
* *Copying a phone number doesn't copy the phone.*
//
Anyone with the number can call the same person.
//
* *Copying a street address doesn't copy the location.*
//
Anyone with the address can navigate to the same spot.
//
* *Copying a social security number doesn't copy the person* footnote:[Is that
even possible?].
//
Anyone with social security number may be able to impersonate that person.

//
If we want to copy an object, we have a few options:

[.s]
//
* `Object` provides a `clone` method
//
* You can implement a _copy_ constructor as shown above

[[yIuWQkMigaAVPvtEIROvoEbkHSwxdNBQ]]
== Shallow v. Deep Copies

[source,java]
----
public class Person {
  public Pet pet;
  Person(Person other) {
    this.pet = other.pet;
  }
}
----

[.lead]
//
What is a potential problem with the copy constructor shown above?

[.s]
//
* It only copies the _reference_ to the `Pet` object. So both the existing and
the new object will share the same `Pet` object.
//
* This is called a _shallow_ copy. A _deep_ copy copies all of the objects so
the old and new object share nothing.

== Review: Reference v. Object Equality

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
public class Person {
  public int age;
  Person(int setAge) {
    this.age = setAge;
  }
  boolean equals(Person other) {
    return this.age == other.age;
  }
}
Person me = new Person(40);
Person other = new Person(40);
System.out.println(me == other);
System.out.println(me.equals(other));
----

[.s]
//
* If two _references_ are equal then they refer to _the same_ object, and
`.equals` is almost always true.
//
* If two references are not equal, the class may still define `.equals` to be
true depending on the value of the instance variables.

[[vdVcDrcyfndBJrDOfJFeeeQnkBfjdelO]]
== References and Method Overriding

[.lead]
//
Note that Java uses the _reference_ type, _not_ the object type when matching
method signatures.

[.s]
//
* If the reference type doesn't match, Java will upcast until it finds a match
or the call fails

Interfaces are an incredibly important idea when building computer programs and
systems.

== What Is An Interface?

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)[Interface:]
//
a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer
system exchange information.
____

[.s]
//
* Interfaces can be between two pieces of software, between software and
hardware, between computers and their users, or between various permutation of
these components.
//
* Interfaces enable different parts of a system to interact in a structured way.

[[TIuSskfZFyHWIeJRkatzJACsXzKQOnCW]]
== Examples of Computer Interfaces

[.s]
//
* *Software-software:* between the test cases that we write and the code that you
complete for each MP or homework problem.
//
* *Software-hardware:* between my laptop and the Chromecast that is displaying
today's lecture slides.
//
* *Computer-user:* computer displays, keyboards, pointing devices, and other
peripherals.

[[kZihYTenzabHfhSeWrCxkpibegcwLXHX]]
== Software Interfaces

[.lead]
//
We're going to focus on software interfaces, and specifically on interfaces in
Java.

[.s]
//
* However, interfaces are _not_ a Java- or language-specific idea.
//
* Some languages&mdash;like Java, Go, and others&mdash;include a specific notion
of interfaces as part of the language.
//
* For other languages this is done by convention.
//
* *But all software development involves interfaces, regardless of what language
you are using.*

[[ekCWZZfsdfEsUsXaLAiqefgmefuSoXyd]]
== Note: Every Java Object Has An Interface

[.lead]
//
Even Java classes that don't `implements` a Java interface provide an interface.
//
**The interface to a Java `class` is the the set of methods that it
provides.**

[[dReSmHaciJqendBXUVzMVldfeiOVfSaB]]
== Interface Documentation

[.lead]
//
Interfaces are also a place where we need _excellent documentation_.

[.s]
//
* This facilitates communication between _users_ of an interface and _providers_
of an interface.
//
* This is exactly what Javadoc is for.
