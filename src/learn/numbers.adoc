== Course Evaluations

[.lead]
//
We take your feedback _very_ seriously.
//
We want CS 125 to improve every semester.

[.s]
//
* Unfortunately the paper forms are slow and the boxes are small, so...
//
* We're also distributing an online survey today that mimics the ICES forms.
//
* **Please complete it _and_ the papers forms!** That way we can get your feedback
right away and at more length.
//
* Also don't miss the top two boxes on the form&mdash;they are squished together
for some reason.
