== Quantity v. Quality

[quote,role='small']
____
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class
into two groups.
//
All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be
graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right
solely on its quality.
//
His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he
would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group:
fifty pound of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on.
//
Those being
graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot - albeit a perfect
one - to get an "A".

**Well, come grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality
were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.**
//
It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of
work&mdash;and learning from their mistakes&mdash;the "quality" group had sat
theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their
efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

ungraded practice problems
//
* 588,765 submissions on the lab, quiz, exam, and homework programming problems...
//
* ...containing _10,718,190_ (!!!) lines of non-commenting code!
//
* Which is roughly 20,000 lines of code per student (!!!).

== Homework: Pain and Glory

And the bugs. Oh, the bugs...

[.s.small]
//
* 588,765 programming problem submissions, resulting in...
//
* 95,721 `checkstyle` errors,

[[nncioidnzgcboyhnMYfzXiJuyeiwGoiJ]]
== Downstream Courses

[.s]
//
* **CS 126**: If you are able to enroll in CS 126, good luck and have fun...
//
* **~CS 126**: ...but that's like a handful of you.
//
So if you _can't_ take CS 126, please do something to be able to continue
programming: CS 196, CS 125 CA, side projects, whatever.
//
* If you take 9 months off and then show up in CS 225 _you will struggle_

[[JCxmJxkAJtiaQHzDNzmViDIdhCqTMpGy]]
== Become a CA!

[.lead]
//
Please consider becoming a CA for Fall 2019!

[.s]
//
* You'll learn an enormous amount.
//
* And it's fun.

== Course Evaluations

[.lead]
//
We take your feedback _very_ seriously.
//
We want CS 125 to improve every semester.

[.s]
//
* Unfortunately the paper forms are slow and the boxes are small, so...
//
* We're also distributing an online survey today that mimics the ICES forms.
//
* **Please complete it _and_ the papers forms!** That way we can get your feedback
right away and at more length.
//
* Also don't miss the top two boxes on the form&mdash;they are squished together
for some reason.
