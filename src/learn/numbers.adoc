*Quite well*:

== What Now?

[[nncioidnzgcboyhnMYfzXiJuyeiwGoiJ]]
== Downstream Courses

[.s]
//
* **CS 126**: If you are able to enroll in CS 126, good luck and have fun...
//
* **~CS 126**: ...but that's like a handful of you.
//
So if you _can't_ take CS 126, please do something to be able to continue
programming: CS 196, CS 125 CA, side projects, whatever.
//
* If you take 9 months off and then show up in CS 225 _you will struggle_
