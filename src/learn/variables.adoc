== Our Approach

[.s]
//
* Start small: with just a few lines of code
//
* Work up to slightly more complicated examples
//
* Then to complete functions and algorithms
//
* And eventually to understanding entire files of Java code

== Quantity v. Quality

[quote,role='small']
____
The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class
into two groups.
//
All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the
quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.
//
His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his
bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pound of pots
rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on.
//
Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one
pot&mdash;albeit a perfect one&mdash;to get an "A".

[.s]
//
--
**Well, come grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality
were all produced by the group being graded for quantity.**
//
It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of
work&mdash;and learning from their mistakes&mdash;the "quality" group had sat
theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their
efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

. *Basic math*
//
. Simple decision making
//
. Doing things over and over again very, very fast
//
. *Storing data*

== Variable Declaration

[source,java,linenums]
----
// I declare a variable named c of type char
char c;

// I'm going to use an int and call it first
int first;

// I hereby create a boolean and shall name it isSet
boolean isSet;
----

[.s]
//
* In Java every variable has a _name_ and a _type_
//
* The name is for you, the programmer
//
* The type is both for you and for Java

[[pRyNruakCGYMibaQiXiRPYtFSICkIVgF]]
== Variable Names Must Be Unique

[source,java]
----
// I declare a variable named c of type char
char c;

// This doesn't work. How will I tell them apart?
int c;

// Even this doesn't work if c has already been declared.
char c;
----

* There are rules allowing the same name to be used in multiple places in the
same program
//
* We'll learn about them soon

[[CsumONHCkuznIwwqbsOFPqYGzdhjQLYE]]
== Good Variable Names

[.lead]
//
Choosing good variable names will make your life a lot easier as a programmer.

Good variable names are:

[.s]
//
. Descriptive
//
. Indicative of the variable's function
//
. As succinct as possible...
//
. But see #2 above
//
. This will make more sense as we go along

[[EILFHOZETEGZEDCURSNNWICQQTXIHYDQ]]
== Variable Naming Example

Just so that you know that I practice what I preach:

[source,java]
----
for (int i = startingPoint; i < doubles.length; i++) {
    if (doubles[i] > maximum || i == startingPoint) {
        maximum = doubles[i];
    }
}
----

(This is code from the Spring 2018 MP0 solution set.)

== Comments

[source,java]
----
// Also: this is a single-line comment.
// It starts with a //

/*
 * Here is another one. Multiline comments start with /* and end with
 */

// Comments are ignored by the computer, but can be
// some of the most important parts of your code
// They're for you and other humans

== Variable Types

[.lead]
//
Java has _eight_
//
http://cs.fit.edu/~ryan/java/language/java-data.html[primitive data types].

All other data in Java is represented by _combinations_ of these building blocks.
//
You can break them into four categories:

[.s]
//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`
//
. *Character*: `char`
//
. *True or false*: `boolean`

And how computers represent information.

[[eIhzSGdomQfxADXtZqDXzjXGEAqMmsWK]]
== Variable Initialization

[source,java]
----
// I declare a variable named mine of type float
// and initialize it to 0.1
float mine = 0.1;

// Let there be a boolean called isItSnowing
// and initialize it to false
boolean isItSnowing = false;

// Declare timeSince1979 of type long
// and initially set it to 1204209
long timeSince1979 = 1204209;
----

[[PFgALdBwLvDVYkQRHZTIGjXoueZTccDF]]
== Experimenting With Initialization

[.janini]
....
// Let's create and initialize some variables of different types
double x;
System.out.println(x);
// Try reinitializing the same variable to see what happens
....

[[mnqvSopbyJJQZGqGLivHdtSjHypzpwxd]]
== Literals

A _literal_ is a number or other value that appears directly in the source
code.

[source,java]
----
// 1000 is a long literal. Note the L suffix.
long big = 1000L;

// 'g' is a character literal.
char one = 'g';

// true and false are boolean literals.
boolean itsEarly = true;
boolean iSleptWell = false;
----

[[xnWysQQnbfFCUmWTfBvEpvXdTqHDwXlL]]
== Variables Can Be Modified

[.janini]
....
// Let's modify some integers
int changing = 10;
changing = 20; // I can set them again
changing = 20 + 10; // Math is OK on the right side
changing += 1; // I have some special operators
changing /= 2; // +, -, / and * all work with =
....

[[upWVceueDWDXMLtzpLzaAIKPyAJKeHTm]]
== Variables Must Maintain the Same Type

[.janini]
....
// Ruh-roh...
int changing = 10;
changing = 10.0;
....

[[wGIfxmUfDEWxDVwvbMGAIYmZqXltNoYR]]
== Variables Can Be Modified Using Other Variables

[.janini]
....
double first = 10.0;
double second = 5.0;
first = second; // This is assignment, not equality
second = 20.0;
first = second + 10.0;
double third = 2.0;
first = second + third;
....

[[flxBJUbKdOinyRtOmdidhiOTCJGDeRMy]]
== This is Not Algebra

[.janini]
....
int z = 10;
z = z + 1; // WTF?
System.out.println(z);
....

[[OMZMbfnYVaynkvZBlALgdedbZonRZyzm]]
== This is Not English

[.janini]
....
// Read assignment from left to right
double first = 10.0;
double second = 5.0;
first = first + second + 10.0;

== What Makes Primitive Types _Primitive_?

* They can all be stored by the computer as a _single number_.

== Our First Example of a _Convention_

[.lead]
//
There's no law of the universe that says that the number 97 should represent
'a'.

It's just what we've all agreed on.

[[IffEzqifWagrJAUVhbtbZpBeXbJOthRh]]
== Why Are There Multiple Numeric Types?

[.lead]
//
. *Integers*: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`
//
. *Floating point numbers*: `float`, `double`

[.s]
--
Different types take up different amounts of _computer memory_ and so can store
different values.
--

[.s]
//
--
//
*Don't worry too much about how things are stored yet.*
//
But the limits are important to be aware of.
