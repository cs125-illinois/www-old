== Review: Hash Functions

[.lead]
//
Imagine I told you that there was a function with the following
properties:

[.s]
//
* *Determinism*: it can convert an arbitrary amount of data into a single
limited-size value. If we repeat the computation on the same data, we get the
same value.
//
* *Uniformity*: over many inputs, each output value is equally likely.
//
* *Efficiency*: it is efficient to compute.

____
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function#Properties[A hash function]
//
is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed
size.
//
The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes,
digests, or simply hashes.

[[TpBEMwHpxtautSSBbbBkYnAlTRpvClcL]]
== Hash Collisions

[.lead]
//
If a hash function produces the _same_ hash for two _different_ inputs this is
called a _collision_.

[.s]
//
* In some cases, particularly if the size of the hash is small, collisions are
expected and we plan to deal with them.
//
* If the size of the hash is large enough and the hash function is uniform,
collisions should _never happen_ and the world will end if they do. (Or at least
`git` will stop working and my world will end.)

== The Birthday Paradox

[.lead]
//
In a room with 100 students, what is the probability that _two_ will share the
same birthday footnote:[Obviously birthdays are not uniformly distributed across
the calendar, for, um, obvious reasons?]? [.s]#*99.9999%*#

[.s]
//
* Does anybody know how many you need to get a 50% chance? [.s]#Only _23_!#
//
* This is bad for our hash functions... collisions are more likely than we might
think!

== Birthday Hashing Paradox

[.lead]
//
How many documents do I have to hash before I find two with the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack[same hash with _50%_ probability?]

[.s.small]
//
* It depends on how large the hash is!
//
* For 16 bits, 300. (The MP6 starter code had 80 files in it.)
//
* For 32 bits, 77,000 (My computer has 2.5 million files on it.)
//
* For 64 bits, 5 billion (GitHub.com has 1 billion files.)
//
* For 128 bits, 14,000,000,000,000,000,000. (Now we're getting warmer.)
//
* (Git actually uses a 160-bit hash function.)
//
* For 512 bits, 1.4 * 10^77 (The universe only has ~10^78 atoms, so this is
probably enough.)

int[] numbers = new int[] { 5, 6, 7 };

numbers[1] = 8;

//
* Arrays map an _index_ (0, 1, 2, `array.length` to a value).

A Java `Map` allows us to use _any object_ like an array index.

Map<String, Integer> stringValues = new HashMap<>();

stringLengths.put("test", 7);
System.out.println(stringLengths.get("test")); // Prints 7

== A Map By Any Other Name

[.lead]
//
Maps are one of the two data structures you meet in heaven. (Along with lists.)
Every language has them:

[.s.small]
//
* Python calls them dictionaries: `dict["key"] = "value"`
//
* JavaScript calls them anonymous objects `dict["key"] = "value"`
//
* C++ calls them maps: `dict.insert(std::make_pair("key", "value"));`
//
* Go calls them maps: `dict["key"] = "value"`
//
* Even Perl had them: `$dict{'key'} = "value"`!
//
* Sometimes we call them _key-value stores_, since each key maps to a single value

== Brief `Map` Implementation

[.lead]
//
So how do we implement a `Map`?

[.s]
//
* Use a `hashCode` to retrieve a hash code for each object.
//
* Use that value&mdash;or a smaller part of it&mdash;as an index into an array.
//
* But what about collisions?

== `HashMap` Performance

[.lead]
//
Let's consider the performance of our simple `HashMap` in two cases. First, if
the array is *very small* relative to the number of items:

[.s]
//
* *`put`*: [.s]#O(n) with n being the number of items#
//
* *`get`*: [.s]#O(n) with n being the number of items#
//
* At this point the `HashMap` is acting [.s]#like a _linked list_.#

//
Let's consider the performance of our simple `HashMap` in two cases. Second, if
the array is *very large* relative to the number of items:

[.s]
//
* *`put`*: [.s]#O(1)#
//

//
* What's the problem? [.s]#It requires _a lot_ of space.#

[[kteyvggYdbvCdQkBtRmnnvWPfabuQoeJ]]
== Realistic `HashMap` Performance

[.lead]
//
In reality we want our `HashMap` to blend the good features of an array and a
linked list.

[.s]
//
* Usually implementations will _enlarge_ the array part of a `HashMap` once it
gets filled past a certain point (called the _load factor_).

This is cool stuff!

[[OlLkUqBdqugqchaDKdWOFMJMRXdgmfyW]]
== And cooler still...

Hash functions already provide:

[.small]
//
* *Determinism*: it can convert an arbitrary amount of data into a single
limited-size value. If we repeat the computation on the same data, we get the
same value.
//
* *Uniformity*: over many inputs, each output value is equally likely.
//
* [.line-through]#*Efficiency*: it is efficient to compute.#

But what if there were hash functions with the following _new_ properties:

[.s.small]
//
* Given the hash, it is _infeasible_ to determine the original input
//
* A small change to the input produces a _large_ change in the output
//
* The function is _difficult_ to compute, not easy

[[ahHxfzfBcLQvvuWqeAEfuFsGFcjqWsMQ]]
== Cryptographic Hash Functions

[.lead]
//
A hash function that satisfies these properties is known as a _cryptographic
hash function_, largely because they are ubiquitous in modern cryptography.

[[PdxviDVjqwEyJNsBsEAQRzzhphhYRviR]]
== A Simple Example

[.lead]
//
I need to be able to check your password, but I don't want to save it.
//
*Is that possible?*

[.s.small]
//
* *Yes!*
//
* Save the cryptographic hash of your password, not the password itself.
//
* When you submit your password, I hash it and compare it with the saved hash.
//
* If someone steals my database, they can't recover the original passwords.
//
** Given the hashes, you can't recover the original passwords
//
** Hash values reveal nothing about how close you are to the actual password
//
** Hashing inputs to test them is expensive

//
Heard of blockchain?

Blocks are linked through _cryptographic hashes_.
//
And the blockchain is secured through an old idea called

[.s]
//
* Given a hash value of a given size, I can estimate how much work you'll have
to do to guess the input that produced that value
//
* So I can force you to do that work and verify that you did it easily by
hashing the value that you gave me

* Bob: "Geez, that's hard. Give me a few minutes... OK, got it."
//
* Alice: "Wow, you're right. I computed the hash and it's
`39c3aa4015e7964914c311915316a2f78157c946` that must have been hard."

In computer science, a

is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given
the function's output for a random input.

In fact, their existence would prove that the complexity classes P and NP are
