== Programming Styles

[.lead]
//
This semester we've introduced you to three different programming styles using
Java:

[.s]
//
* **Imperative programming:** using a series of statements to show the computer
how to solve a problem
//
* **Object-oriented programming:** using objects to combine program state (data)
and behavior (algorithms)
//
* **Recursive programming:** solving problems by breaking them into smaller
pieces

[[fVNFQKVAPMtQWECbhsQAlJXTdnbGpZed]]
== Beyond Java

[.lead]
//
But there's a lot more to learn about _both_ computer science _and_ programming

[.s.small]
//
* Most working programmers know multiple different languages
//
* Frequently those multiple languages will enable programming in multiple
_environments_ and in different _styles_
//
* Solving a problem then starts by choosing the right language
//
* Many of today's languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, C{plus}{plus}) also support multiple programming styles or
_paradigms_
//
* You can find lots of advice online about which to use

[[efLqznupjFgZOnVBCLbqgejjeWnZyyGn]]
== Powerful Programming

[.lead]
//
The following argument is a reprise of part of
//
http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html[an article]
//
by
//
http://www.paulgraham.com[Paul Graham], famous Silicon Valley entrepreneur.

[.s.small]
//
* Programming styles vary in power
//
* In general you want to choose the most powerful style available
//
* (There are many exceptions to this rule. Sometimes your choice is
constrained by what you want to do, or by needing to use a particular library or
language.)
//
* Programmers typically find less-powerful styles familiar but limited
//
* **Programmers typically find more-powerful styles unfamiliar and
bewildering**

[[qXnIdMRIZdbSdMRcMwqeOxmTIgjJbnnR]]
== Looking Up

[quote,Paraphrased from Paul Graham,role='small']
____
As long as our hypothetical programmer is looking down the power continuum,
she knows she's looking down.
//
Styles less powerful than the one she uses are obviously less powerful,
because they're missing some feature she's used to.
//
But when our hypothetical programmer looks in the other direction, up the
power continuum, she doesn't realize she's looking up.
//
What she sees are merely weird styles.
//
She probably considers them about equivalent in power to what she's used to, but
with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well.
//
How she programs is good enough for her, because it's how she thinks.

(Paraphrased from
//
http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html[this article].)

== Our Progression

[.lead]
//
Let's think about how we arrived at today:

[.s.small]
//
* *Purely imperative:* you _can_ solve every problem by just writing one class,
but you wouldn't want to because you'd rather...
//
* *Object-oriented*: ...use objects to combine state and behavior and allow you to
model real-world entities. Like trees, which you could walk iteratively
except...
//
* *Recursive*: ...that recursion provides a much cleaner and more powerful way to
program using trees.
//
* For many of you one or several of these concepts was new and unfamiliar at
first, but then became more natural with practice

== But There's More Ahead&mdash;Or Above

[[TpVpuinPzuJJaCPBVRfCzlvuHUgerwCn]]
== Motivating Example

[.lead]
//
Let's imagine we have a group of dogs with ages and birthdays stored in a `Dog`
class.

Say we want to write a function that, given a list of `Dog` objects, finds ones
matching some criteria.

[[eFfSpXdKFTPekWfcuaGadqeOnZjRcDen]]
== ! Motivating Example

[.janini.jdk.compiler.smaller]
....
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Dog {
  private int age;
  private int birthday;
  private String name;
  Dog(int setAge, int setBirthday, String setName) {
    age = setAge;
    birthday = setBirthday;
    name = setName;
  }
  void incrementAge() {
    age++;
  }
  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }
  public int getBirthday() {
    return birthday;
  }
  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }
  public String toString() {

}
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] unused) {
    List<Dog> dogs = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(new Dog[] {
      new Dog(14, 100, "Chuchu"),
      new Dog(15, 88, "Balou"),
      new Dog(3, 88, "Lulu")
    }));
    int today = 100;
  }
}
....

[[DHNheBYnGsfqRtwXNjLdANOJeZKvUIXv]]
== Imperative Programming

[.lead]
//
Writing _imperative_ code forces you to tell the computer exactly _how_ to do
everything:

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
List<Dog> birthdayDogs = new ArrayList<>();
for (Dog dog : dogs) {
  if (dog.getBirthday() == today) {
    birthdayDogs.add(dog);
  }
}
----

[[gikCbdfUjaWWUemfVNEuvddbDLHdJOAD]]
== Declarative Programming

[.lead]
//
Writing _declarative_ code allows you to tell the computer _what_ you want and
let it figure out how to accomplish it:

[source,java]
----
// Give me only the items in dogs where dog.getBirthday() == today
// How do we do that?
----

[[tIkjJxiyaeloZPqBuRyKrgPzRKpqCiqV]]
== Dog Filtering

[source,java]
----
List<Dog> filterDogs(List<Dog> dogs, // filter specification...?) {
  List<Dog> filteredDogs = new ArrayList<>();
  for (Dog dog : dogs) {
    // if dog should be in the list, add it
  }
  return filteredDogs;
}
----

We need to pass _something_ to `filterDogs` that allows the caller to specify
which dogs should be included in as general a way as possible.

[[CugmZjnredCTmEzxbrxDFeChqsxlxsAx]]
== First-Class Functions

Many programming languages support so-called _first class functions_, meaning
that functions can be stored as variables and passed to other functions:

[source,javascript,role='smaller s']
----
function filterDogs(dogs, filter) {
  filteredDogs = []
  for (dog of dogs) {
    if (filter(dog)) {
      filteredDogs.push(dog)
    }
  }
  return filteredDogs;
}
const filteredDogs = filterDogs(dogs, dog => { return dog.age > 10 })
----

[.s]
//
* But why am I showing you _JavaScript_ code above, rather than Java code?
//
* **Because Java doesn't support first-class functions.** Doh!

[[RGGuufmzfEDMmYQgZQfedhhMhNubKfcQ]]
== Let's Regroup

[source,java]
----
List<Dog> filterDogs(List<Dog> dogs, // filter specification...?) {
  List<Dog> filteredDogs = new ArrayList<>();
  for (Dog dog : dogs) {
    // if dog should be in the list, add it
  }
  return filteredDogs;
}
----

[.s]
//
* `filterDogs` needs guarantees about what it can do with it's second
argument...
//
* ...but the goal is still to provide a flexible filtering function.
//
* We've seen something like this before.

[[sezobeeHyKfOiflNRuZgdWyfrrDmiLoQ]]
== Interfaces to the Rescue

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
interface DogFilter {
  boolean include(Dog dog);
}
List<Dog> filterDogs(List<Dog> dogs, DogFilter dogFilter) {
  List<Dog> filteredDogs = new ArrayList<>();
  for (Dog dog : dogs) {
    if (dogFilter.include(dog)) {
      filteredDogs.add(dog);
    }
  }
  return filteredDogs;
}
----

[.s]
//
* `filterDogs` knows that it can call `include` on `dogFilter` and get a
`boolean`
//
* But the caller can _implement_ `dogFilter` any way it wants!

[[ORjogVzdVIjqnCesUpfdznGILnAhuJGn]]

    }));
    int today = 100;
  }

....

[[dSLSCnetSvrWojALwFbhezSrwSDfubpB]]
== Anonymous Classes

We can make this a bit cleaner with the help of some new Java syntax: _anonymous
classes_.

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
public interface DogFilter {
  boolean include(Dog dog);
}
// Use new on the interface type...
DogFilter birthdayFilter = new DogFilter() {
  // And immediately provide an implementation
  public boolean include(Dog dog) {
    return dog.getBirthday() == 100;
  }
}
----

[.s.small]
//
* That implementation of `DogFilter` is now stored in reference variable
`birthdayFilter`
//
* But otherwise has no name, hence it being an _anonymous_ class
//
* Anonymous classes are convenient when you only use a class once

[[qurGzdAAfheiNehiOnUckiBMbuyOJDek]]
== Anonymous Classes: Extension

[.lead]
//
Anonymous classes can also be used to extend an existing class and override its
methods.

[source,java]
----
public class Dog {
  String toString() {
    return "Dog";
  }
}
Dog sweetOldDog = new Dog() {
  String toString() {
    return "SweetOldDog";
  }

[[RRIYKLVLZdmbTBpkakTeKMGjwYxjFaZP]]
== And Cleaner Still With Lambda Expressions

We can make this even cleaner yet with the help of some new Java syntax: _lambda
expressions_.

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
public interface DogFilter {
  boolean include(Dog dog);
}
DogFilter birthdayFilter = new DogFilter() {
  public boolean include(Dog dog) {
    return dog.getBirthday() == 100;
  }
}
// Is the same as
DogFilter birthdayFilter = (dog) -> { return dog.getBirthday() == 100; };
// Or, even cleaner
DogFilter birthdayFilter = (dog) -> dog.getBirthday() == 100;
----

[[BddtxfJnBqJRnfbQEVGuRHsrTVLWsTdD]]
== Lambda Functions

[quote]
//
____
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function[An anonymous function]
//
(function literal, lambda abstraction, or lambda expression) is a function
definition that is not bound to an identifier.
//
Anonymous functions are often arguments being passed to higher-order functions,
or used for constructing the result of a higher-order function that needs to
return a function.
//
____

[.s]
//
* The name lambda comes from the work of Alonzo Church on the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus[λ-calculus]:
//
a formal system for expression computation mathematically
//
* Many programming languages have lambda functions. (Python actually uses the
`lambda` keyword to declare one.)

[[tkfYVlZCkMNGdasDCFmqVKnBeMumdnez]]
== First-Class Functions in Java

[source,java,role='smaller']
----
public interface DogFilter {
  boolean include(Dog dog);
}
DogFilter birthdayFilter = (dog) -> dog.getBirthday() == 100;
----

So while Java does not have first-class functions, but we can approximate them
using:

[.s]
//
* **Functional interfaces**: interfaces that only require implementing a single
method
//
* **Lambda expressions**: by using the arrow syntax we can cleanly provide an
anonymous class that implements the single function of a functional interface

[.lead]
//
When operating on collections of items (like lists) certain higher-order
operations are common:

list

== Functional Programming

[.lead]
//
What we've been doing today is exploring Java's support for _functional
programming_.

As a style, functional programming emphasizes:

[.s]
//
* Solving problems by composing functions rather than writing loops
//
* Which leads to declarative rather than imperative code
//
* Reusable higher-order functions like `removeIf`, `map`, and `filter`

[[wdZkTDBemdbsChECpCGIlPXjyFGZBCoi]]
== Functional Java

[.lead]
//
While Java supports some aspects of functional programming, it's a worse fit for
others:

[.s]
//
* Pure functions and immutable data fly in the face of object-oriented
programming
//
* So if you want to really learn functional programming, learn a more strict
functional language like
