  behind-the-scenes look at what happens when your code is compiled and
  executed.

What is the return type of the function declared above?

What will the value of `counter` be when the code above finishes executing?

Remember the `while` loop?

[source,java]

while (condition) {
  // do something
}

It also has a friend:

do {
  // do something

What's the difference?

== Switch Statements

[.lead]
//
`switch` is more limited than `if-else`, but also more flexible:

[.s]
//
* It only works for testing primitive types and ``String``s
//
* But you can match multiple ``case``s in a single `switch` statement
//
* Execution _starts_ at a matching `case` statement and continues until a
`break` statement is reached

  default: System.out.println("E");

== Compilation and Execution

(And now, a small digression.)

[.lead]
//
So far we've been letting you admire the magic that happens when you execute
Java code.
//
*But what is actually happening?*

[.s.small]
//
* As a computer scientist, part of your job is to be curious about how things
work!
//
* This will also help clear up a few things that may have been confusing to you
up until this point...
//
* It's also quite interesting...
//
* ...but note that I am _not_ going to go into detail here

== When You Run Java Code

[.lead]
//
Roughly speaking, when you run your Java code&mdash;on our playground, on
PrairieLearn, or in IntelliJ&mdash;the process works like this:

[.s.small]
//
. *Compilation*: your Java source code is _compiled_ to a simpler representation
called _Java bytecode_ by the Java compiler (`javac`).
//
** Errors that occur at this stage are called _compilation errors_.
//
** *If your code doesn't compile, it doesn't run.*
//
. *Execution*: the bytecode from Step 1 is then executed by a program called the
_Java Virtual Machine (JVM)_ (`java`).
//
** Errors that occur at this stage are called _runtime errors_.

[[JCCTJPYQOUSCCQDZVZDLGAUZSKUWATHT]]
== Compiler Errors v. Runtime Errors

[.lead]
//
Java and many languages that followed it have tried to transform _runtime_
errors into _compiler_ errors.
//
*Why?*

[.s]
//
* You compile your code _before_ it runs: and so before you have to demo it to a
client, or before you deploy it to hundreds of users.
//
* Catching errors at this stage is _critical_.

// So why does Java let me do this?

[[LHLVEXWGCVWQGGJZMWCFBFDBIBNDSMIF]]
== Java Compilation: `javac`

[.lead]
//
The Java compiler transforms Java source code into Java bytecode.
//
On many machines it is a program called `javac`.

(Quick demo.)

[[QOIVVLJAVZSGCJKWBAFBLSINDNNGWKVG]]
== Java Execution: `java`

[.lead]
//
The Java Virtual Machine executes Java bytecode.
//
On many machines it is a program simply called `java`.

(Quick demo.)

[[BMJGEVQAZRRSCRAXFKBLJHQOZAHRQXIO]]
== Bytecode v. Machine Code

[.s]
//
* Many compiled languages compile into instructions that an actual CPU or
processor can execute&mdash;we call this _machine code_.
//
* Java does not&mdash;it compiles into _bytecode_ that is then run by the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM), a piece of _software_.
//
* *Why?*

[[FOQRONBLILYFXJEJXZOYVWKAIRVUJXZJ]]
== Write Once, Run Anywhere (TM)

(I will do my best to avoid a truly Wallacian stem-winder of a digression here,
since this is a truly fascinating story.)

[.s.small]
//
* Different computer processors use different instructions&mdash;this is still
true today, but was even more true when Java was being designed
//
** (This is kind of like them speaking different languages.)
//
* So if I take a program that was compiled for an `x86` processor and try to run
it on an `ARM` processor, it won't work
//
* But if I take a _Java_ program that was compiled into Java bytecode I can run
it anywhere...
//
* ...as long as that computer has the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
//
* (This is the difference between the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the
Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK includes `javac`, the JRE does
not.)

the compiler can determine what it should be

[.lead]
//
You've been using and even writing `main` methods?
//
But _what is it_?

[source,java]
----
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] unused) {
    System.out.println("And this is it!");
  }
}
----

[.s]
//
* When Java runs your program, execution has to start _somewhere_.
//
* If a class has a `main` method Java can execute that class and begin the
process of running a program.
//
* So _every_ Java application starts in `main` somewhere.

But why is `main` passed an array of ``Strings``s (that we sometimes ignore)?
