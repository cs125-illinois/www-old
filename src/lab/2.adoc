//
Today's lab gives you more practice designing computer _algorithms_: the sets of
steps that a computer takes to solve a problem.
//
You'll design an algorithm with your lab and then implement it as a homework
problem.
//
Next we've set aside time for you to begin work on
//
link:/MP/0/[MP0],
//
our first machine project checkpoint, which is due in under two weeks!

[[algorithms]]
== Algorithm Design and Implementation [.text-muted]#(30 Minutes Total)#

[.lead]
//
In class we've begun to discuss the process of designing and implementing
computer algorithms.
//
Remember that an algorithm is _not_ computer code&mdash;it's a way to solve a
problem that can be implemented in a variety of computer languages.
//
In this way we distinguish between the _algorithm itself_ and a specific
_implementation_ of that algorithm.

Today we'll give you more practice designing and implementing a computer
algorithm to solve a specific problem.
//
Our goal is to focus your attention on the _process_: design first,
implementation second.

=== Algorithm Design: Least Common Multiple [.text-muted]#(10 Minutes)#

Too often beginning computer scientists tend to rush into trying to implement a
solution before they really understand what they are trying to accomplish.
//
Trust me: if you don't know what you are trying to do, you'll never be able to
code it up.
//
Even when you _do_ know exactly what you are trying to do it's still often hard
to translate that into working code.
//
But without a design you are truly lost at sea.

So today we've set up the homework to prevent you from just jumping right in to
the code
//
You *must* spend the next 10 minutes designing a algorithm with the rest of your
lab.
//
Only then can you begin to implement and test it.

The problem you are going to solve is computing the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple[least common multiple (or
LCM)]
//
of two integers.
//
As it's name implies, the LCM is the _smallest_ number that is a whole multiple
of each number.
//
So, for example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12, because 12 is 4 * 3 and 2 * 6.

You can easily find complex and efficient algorithms for computing the LCM
online.
//
However, our goal today is not to force you to implement something
sophisticated.
//
Rather, you should take advantage of the fact that computers can repeat
operations extremely quickly&mdash;one of their most important capabilities.
//
We can frequently use this capability to our advantage, since it can allow us to
use a simpler but less efficient approach to solving a problem&mdash;at least in
cases where we are not _too_ concerned with how long the computation takes.

**Work with your partner and other members of your lab to come up with an
algorithm to compute the LCM.**
//
Talk to each other, brainstorm on whiteboards, exchange ideas, work through
examples.
//
About the only thing that you should _not_ do is use your computer.

Your lab may develop several different solutions to this problem.
//
That's great!
//
If you do, discuss some of the tradeoffs between the two.
//
Which is harder to understand?
//
Which do you expect to complete more quickly?

=== Implement LCM [.text-muted]#(20 Minutes)#

Next, you should 20 minutes on our in-lab homework problem, which you can find
on PrairieLearn.
//
**Just like last week, you will only be able to access this homework beginning
10 minutes after your lab starts and ending 20 minutes later.**
//
If you are in the wrong lab you will not be able to complete the lab
homework assignment&mdash;please attend the right lab next time.

Please feel free to work with a partner or in a small group on the lab
homework.
//
**But every student must submit their own answers to receive credit.**

[[mp0]]
== Getting Started on MP0 [.text-muted]#(Remaining Time)#

We've set aside the remainder of lab for you to work on
//
link:/MP/0/[MP0].
//
Please take advantage of this opportunity to work with your lab mates and course
staff!
//
If you haven't started, your goal should be to get to the point where you have
submitted for the first time&mdash;and maybe even earned a few points!
//
If you have started, your goal should be to make some progress.
//
And if you've _finished_ footnote:[Really? Wow!], then help out others around
you.

[[done]]
== Before You Leave

**Don't leave lab until**:

. You've designed your LCM algorithm and completed our second lab homework problem
//
. You've made some progress on link:/MP/0/[MP0]...
//
. And so has everyone else in your lab!
