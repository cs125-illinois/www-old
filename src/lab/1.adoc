//
Today's lab begins teaching you to debug and starts preparing you to work on
this semester's Android-based machine project.
//
You'll start by completing some in-lab homework problems that help you learn to
debug problems with your code.
//
Next you'll start preparing your Android development environment&mdash;although
we expect you to return to office hours this week to complete this task.

== Learning How to Debug [.text-muted]#(40 Minutes Total)#

Programmers never stop making mistakes.
//
I've been doing this for 20 years footnote:[this fall!] and I make many, many programming
mistakes every day.
//
What you _do_ get better at is fixing them, quickly, so that they don't slow you
down and you can get on with your business of changing the world.

Our first lab homework assignment today is designed to help you learn to do
that.
//
This knowledge will come in handy in all of your future programming
tasks&mdash;but definitely during your CS 125 CBTF quizzes this semester, where
you may small mistakes and be pressed for time.

Oh, and in case you're wondering, programmers have long referred to fixing
mistakes in their code as
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging[_debugging_],
//
a term attributed at least in part to
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper[computer science pioneer Grace Hopper]
//
footnote:[Who was also https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-vcErOPofQ[great on
Letterman].].

=== Understanding Your Program's Output [.text-muted]#(10 Minutes)#

A key part of learning to debug effectively is understanding the various kinds
of output that your program produces.
//
You _can_ just stare at your code and try to figure out what's wrong&mdash;that
might work, eventually, maybe.
//
But it's slow.
//
**Frequently a much faster route is to use the output that the computer provides
when testing your code to help you fix it.**

Note that this is not just an artifact of how we do things in CS 125.
//
Every large tech company has sophisticated systems for testing their code before
it is released to users or to the public.
//
This is because mistakes can be both embarrassing and expensive, so it's better
to test things first rather than try to clean up the mess later.
//
Before modifications get made to widely-used pieces of software like, say, the
Chrome browser, those changes go through extensive automated testing along with
multiple rounds of review by other human developers.
//
So increasingly one of the many things that computers are helping automate is
the process of testing changes to their own code!

When you submit your program for grading in CS 125 the following steps
take place.

==== Code Format Checking

First, we test the _format_ of your code using
//
http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/[`checkstyle`],
//
a program that checks it against a set of rules about how Java code should be
formatted.
//
We do this because writing _readable_ code is as important as writing _correct_
code.

For example, the following code has a `checkstyle` error&mdash;can you spot what
it is?

[source,java]
----
if (x>0) {
  System.out.println("x is positive");
}
----

`checkstyle` produces error messages that look like this (note that this is
_not_ for the snippet above):

[source]
----
[ERROR] /base/src/main/java/Question.java:3:10: 'else' is not preceded with whitespace.
[ERROR] /base/src/main/java/Question.java:3:10: '}' is not followed by whitespace.
----

Note that the error message identifies the line number (3) where the error
occurs, along with a brief human-readable description of the problem.
//
Given the error message above, can you come up with a snippet that could have
produced this error?

==== Compilation

Second, we try to _compile_ your code using the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_compiler[Java compiler].
//
This is step that we'll discuss more soon in class, but certain kinds of
mistakes can be caught at this point.
//
We sometimes refer to errors identified at this stage as _compiler errors_ or
_syntax errors_.
//
**Note that if the Java compiler can't compile your code we can't run it and
continue with testing, so we stop at this point.**

For example, the following code will produce a compiler error&mdash;can you spot
it?

[source,java]
----
double latitude = 80.98274;
if (latitute > 0) {
  System.out.println("You're in the northern hemisphere");
}
----

The Java compiler can produce all kinds of error messages depending on what you
did wrong.
//
Understanding how to interpret them will _greatly_ improve your ability to fix
errors and perform well on the homework, quizzes, and MPs.
//
Here are a few examples of common mistakes.
//
Note that, like the `checkstyle` errors above, each identifies the line number
where the error took place and provide some information about the problem that
was encountered.
//
For each, see if you can determine a piece of code that could produce that
error.

[source,java]
----
/base/src/main/java/Question.java:2: error: cannot find symbol
        if (currenttime > 10000000) {
            ^
  symbol:   variable currenttime
  location: class Question
1 error
----

[source,java]
----
/base/src/main/java/Question.java:4: error: reached end of file while parsing
}
 ^
1 error
----

[source,java]
----
/base/src/main/java/Question.java:2: error: ';' expected
            System.out.println("Smaller")
                                         ^
1 error
----

==== Testing

Finally, we run your code using a _test suite_.
//
At that point your program will run, but it might not be correct.
//
For example, we may have asked you to add `x` and `y` but if your code instead
computes `x * y`, then it doesn't match our specification.
//
Our test suite will try and determine this and, if your code doesn't behave
correctly, we'll provide some information about what went wrong.

Usually how we do this is to compare the behavior of your program to what we had
expected.
//
For example, let's say that we instructed you to write a snippet of code that
printed `North Pole` at the appropriate `latitude` and `longitude` and not print
anything otherwise.
//
You submitted the following code:

[source,java]
----
if (latitude == 0.0) {
  System.out.println("North Pole");
} else {
  System.out.println("Not at North Pole");
}
----

What we would do is test your code with different values of `latitude`.
//
First we'd say, let's see if it's right if `latitude` is equal to `0.0`.
//
In that case it does print `North Pole`, so that's good.
//
OK, now what happens if we set `latitude` to `1.0`?
//
We didn't tell you to not print anything otherwise, but you printed `Not at
North Pole`.
//
So you might get an error message something like this:

[source]
----
java.lang.AssertionError: expected [] but found [North Pole]
----

These error messages might look different depending on the problem you are
working on.
//
But in general they describe a mismatch between our _expectations_ of how your
code should behave based on our instructions and the _reality_ of how it worked
when we ran it.

=== Practice Debugging [.text-muted]#(30 Minutes)#

Next, you should use the next 30 minutes on our
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/20716/assessment_instance/733789[in-lab homework].
//
**You will only be able to access this homework beginning 10 minutes after your
lab starts and ending 30 minutes later.**
//
So if your lab starts at 9AM, you can start the homework at 9:10AM and should
complete it by 9:40AM.
//
And if you are in the wrong lab you will not be able to complete the lab
homework assignment&mdash;please attend the right lab next time.

Please feel free to work with a partner or in a small group on the lab
homework.
//
**But every student must submit their own answers to receive credit.**

Note that the best way to approach these debugging problems is _not_ to just
resubmit your solution over and over again.
//
In fact, we've disable cut and paste on these problems to prevent you from doing
that.
//
Instead, first run the code, then use the output to identify the errors, and
then fix them by modifying the code that is in front of you.
//
**All of these errors can be fixed with only a few keystrokes.**

== Installing and Using Android Studio [.text-muted]#(Remaining Time)#

Next, begin working through our
//
link:/MP/setup/android-studio[Android Studio setup tutorial].
//
Ask for help if you get stuck&mdash;installing complicated software can be
tricky.

To work on our CS 125 MPs, you will need either an Android device or a working
emulator&mdash;even if it runs a bit slowly.
//
Again, work with the course staff to try and complete this portion of the lab,
and plan on returning during office hours later this week.

**Note that if you have an Android device you should
//
link:/MP/setup/android-studio/#devices[use it for Android development].**
//
Even an old and slow Android device can provide a more enjoyable
development environment than using the emulator on a powerful laptop.

[[done]]
== Before You Leave

**Don't leave lab until**:

. You've reviewed our <<debugging, debugging instructions>> and completed our
first
//
https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/course_instance/20716/assessment_instance/733789[in-lab homework].
//
. You've _started_ installing and learning to use Android Studio.
//
Again, we *do not* expect you to finish this in lab.
//
Schedule some time to come to link:/info/syllabus#calendar[office hours] this
week to complete this task.
//
Or post on the {forum} and we'll be happy to help.
