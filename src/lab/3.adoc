//
Today's lab gives you _even_ more practice designing computer _algorithms_: the
sets of steps that a computer takes to solve a problem.
//
You'll design a string-processing algorithm with your lab and then implement it
as a homework problem.
//
If you have extra time, working on finishing up link:/MP/0/[MP0], your first MP
checkpoint, which is due this coming weekend.

== String Algorithm Design and Implementation [.text-muted]#(60 Minutes Total)#

[.lead]
//
Recently we've discussed both computer algorithms&mdash;the steps a computer uses to
solve a problem&mdash;and strings&mdash;how computers store text.

Today's lab bring's both together, providing you with practice at algorithm
design and implementation using Java's `String` class.
//
To successfully complete today's lab homework you'll have to _both_ design your
algorithm carefully and learn more about Java ``String``s to implement it.

=== Design ROT13 Encryption [.text-muted]#(10 Minutes)#

Like last week, today's lab prevents you from trying to jump right into the
code.
//
You *must* spend the next 20 minutes designing a algorithm with the rest of your
lab.
//
You'll also want to spend some time reviewing the
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/String.html[`String`
documentation]
//
to find useful methods to aid your implementation.
//
Only then can you begin to implement and test it.

Today our challenge is to implement
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher[a so-called Caesar cipher].
//
This is a primitive form of encryption known as a _substitution cipher_, where
each letter in a message or string is replaced with a single other letter.
//
In a Caesar cipher each letter is replaced with a letter a fixed places down the
alphabet.
//
So, for example, "CS125" could become "DT236" with each letter replaced with the
letter one place down the alphabet, or "EU347" with each letter replaced with
the letter _two_ places down the alphabet.

**Note that a Caesar cipher is _not_ a secure way to encrypt information.**
//
It may have worked in the days before computers, but now computers can trivially
break any substitution cipher.

Note that to shift a letter down the alphabet we both have to decide what
characters we are going to include _and_ the order in which they appear in our
alphabet.
//
Our examples above assume the standard ordering of characters that we've all
been taught in school and by the song: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMN...", etc.
//
We also need to handle cases where a character shifts around from the end of the
alphabet to the beginning.

=== Implement ROT13 Encryption [.text-muted]#(40 Minutes)#

Next, you should 40 minutes on our in-lab homework problem, which you can find
on PrairieLearn.
//
**Just like last week, you will only be able to access this homework beginning
20 minutes after your lab starts and ending 40 minutes later.**
//
If you are in the wrong lab you will not be able to complete the lab
homework assignment&mdash;please attend the right lab next time.

Please feel free to work with a partner or in a small group on the lab
homework.
//
**But every student must submit their own answers to receive credit.**

Note that to finish this problem you will need to use several `String` methods
that you may have not used before.
//
Please review the
//
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/String.html[`String`
documentation].
//
As a footnote:[fairly big] hint, you may find `indexOf` useful.

[[mp1]]
== Help with MP0 [.text-muted]#(Remaining Time)#

We've set aside the remainder of lab for you to continue working on our first MP
checkpoint:
//
link:/MP/0/[MP0].
//
Please take advantage of this opportunity to work with the rest of your lab and
the course staff!

[[done]]
== Before You Leave

**Don't leave lab until**:

. You've designed your encryption algorithm and completed our third lab homework problem
//
. You've made some more progress on link:/MP/0/[MP0]...
//
. And so has everyone else in your lab!

If you need more help completing the tasks above please come to

or post on the {forum}.
