We've set aside today's lab for you to get started on
//
link:/MP/2/[MP2].

MP2 is yet another challenge _and_ you have a bit less time to complete it
due to a short week before spring break.
//
So please use the lab period to get started and ask for help from the course
staff and your fellow students.
