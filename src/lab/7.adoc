  Today we'll show you how to work with data by modeling it using Java classes.
  You'll learn just a bit about CSV-formatted data, and then design a class and
  some functions to process an existing data set.

//
We've frequently pointed out that Java classes can help you work with _data_.
//
By creating your own Java types you can model real-world entities, allowing you
to both create new data and work with existing data sets.
//
But we haven't given you any change to actually do that yet&mdash;until now.

Today's lab gives you a chance to work with data in the way that you are likely
to find it in the wild&mdash;stored as text in a file.
//
You'll write code to load the data into a Java class that you define, and write
some methods to process it the same way you would if you were performing an
actual data analysis or investigation.

[[csv]]
== CSV [.text-muted]#(60 Minutes Total)#

Both today's lab and link:/MP/2/[MP2] introduce you to different ways of
representing Java objects as text&mdash;one instance of a broader set of
techniques known as
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization[_serialization_].
//
link:/MP/2/[MP2] introduces you to
//
link:/MP/2/#json[JSON], a powerful way to convert Java objects
//
footnote:[along with objects in other object-oriented programming languages]
//
to strings while preserving much of the object's structure.

But in lab today you'll work with the CSV (comma-separated value) format.
//
While it is far more limited than JSON, it is fairly ubiquitous, and many of the
interesting data sets that you can find online you can access in CSV format.

What is the CSV format?
//
Imagine that I have data about pets stored in our usual `Pet` class:

[source,java]
----
public class Pet {
  public String name;
  public int age;
  public String type;
  public Pet(setName, setAge, setType) {
    name = setName;
    age = setAge;
    type = setType;
  }
}
----

Now let's say that I want to save that data to a file.
//
Maybe I want to make sure it is saved so that the next time my program runs I
still have it.
//
Or maybe I need to send it to a friend, or want to work with it using a
spreadsheet tool like Google Sheets.
//
Or maybe I want to do some work in another programming language&mdash;like
Python, or JavaScript, or Go.
//
Regardless: I need some way to _save_ my data about pets so that I can read it
back in later.

CSV is one way to do that.
//
A CSV file consists of a series of _records_, one on each line.
//
Each record contains multiple _fields_, separated by commas.
//
To save a `Pet` record I need to convert each of its fields to a `String` and
write them to a file as a single line, with the fields separated by commas.

So, for example, imagine that I had the following three ``Pet``s in my program:

[source,java]
----
Pet chuchu = new Pet("Chuchu", 14, "dog");
Pet xyz = new Pet("Xyz", 4, "cat");
Pet balou = new Pet("Balou", 15, "dog");
----

Converted to CSV format, those three objects could look like this:

[source,csv]
----
Chuchu,14,dog
Xyz,4,cat
Balou,15,dog
----

However, they could also look like this:

[source,csv]
----
dog,Chuchu,14
cat,Xyz,4
dog,Balou,15
----

Same fields, different order&mdash;confusing!
//
As a result, we usually add a header specifying the name for each field, to
eliminate ambiguity and make sure that we don't forget how we saved our data:

[source,csv]
----
Name,Age,Type
Chuchu,14,dog
Xyz,4,cat
Balou,15,dog
----

=== Data Modeling Using CSV Data

So now you've seen how CSV files are generated using a simple Java class.
//
But how would we do the reverse?
//
Imagine we had a file containing some CSV data and we wanted to load and work
with it in Java.
//
How would we do that?

Imagine that we have a CSV of geocache locations as part of a game we're
playing.
//
Each location is worth a certain amount of points.
//
Here's the CSV header and a few example records:

[source,csv]
----
Latitude,Longitude,Points
40.482979,-88.993390,100
40.197184,-88.366315,-100
----

To design a Java class to model this data requires making a few decisions.

* *What should we call the class?*
//
Usually this requires some information about what it is being used for.
//
* *What should the names of the instance variables be?*
//
Just using the same names as the header is a pretty good convention, although
we'll want to use
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case[camel case]
//
to avoid variables that start with an uppercase letter.
//
* *What should the types of the instance variables be?*
//
Here we want to examine a bit of the data itself.

Here's an example class based on the CSV shown above:

[source,java]
----
public class GeocacheLocation {
  private double latitude;
  private double longitude;
  private int points;
  // Getters and setters not shown
}
----

When modeling data these decisions are yours to make.
//
But adhering to a few simple conventions will help make your code easier to read
and maintain.

=== Converting Records to Objects

Next we have to figure out how, given a line of text like:

[source,csv]
----
40.482979,-88.993390,100
----

We end up with a `GeocacheLocation` object with `latitude == 40.482979`,
`longitude == -88.993390`, and `points == 100`.
//
There are libraries that can do this for you&mdash;but it's not hard to do
yourself.
//
Remember `String.split` and `String.trim`?
//
Those functions come in handy here
//
footnote:[nice time for some review!].
//
And as an additional reminder, `Integer.valueOf` and `Double.valueOf` will
convert a trimmed `String` into an `int` or `double`, respectively.
//
That's a good bit of what you need to know to get started!

=== Loading Entire Files

Once you can convert a single line containing a record to an object of the
appropriate type it's easy to extend this idea to load an entire file containing
multiple records.
//
You end up with an array of objects.
//
So if we loaded:

[source,csv]
----
40.482979,-88.993390,100
40.197184,-88.366315,-100
----

We'd end up with a `GeocacheLocation` array of size 2.

=== Data Processing

Once we have an array of `GeocacheLocation` objects we can work with them like
any other Java objects.
//
For example, if we knew current location we could use it to determine which
`GeocacheLocation` object was closest to us.
//
Or we could find the one worth the most points.
//
At this point we're just writing Java code: the CSV parts are behind us!

=== Practice With CSVs and Data Processing

Today's lab homework gives you practice working with data in the same way as
described above.
//
You don't actually get to read the data from the file&mdash;but you get to do
everything else.
//
This is great practice with object design, and some review of `String`
processing and basic algorithm review as we prepare to begin talking about
algorithms and data structures next week.

Good luck, and, as always, have fun!
//
Hopefully this will help demystify the process of working with data in Java.
