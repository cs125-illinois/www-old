//
In this lab we begin our exploration of _algorithms_, the conceptual heart of
computer science.
//
You'll develop a simple algorithm to escape a maze and implement it in Java.

[[algorithms]]
== Algorithm Design and Implementation [.text-muted]#(50 Minutes)#

[.lead]
//
Let's learn more about algorithms&mdash;systematic ways that we and computers
use to solve problems.

=== Escape Plans

Open and make a copy of
//
https://goo.gl/Qn8Wwg[this maze spreadsheet].  Click "Add Ons -> Maze Creator ->
Redraw Maze” to generate a random maze.
//
Note that you may have to wait a minute for the "Maze Creator" menu to appear.
//
Click through any scary warnings and the script should run.
//
Feel free to change the number of rows and columns to create a larger or smaller
example.

Working with a partner, develop an algorithm to escape from mazes like the ones
drawn on the spreadsheet above.
//
You should limit yourself to the following actions:

* `canMove()`: returns `true` if you can move forward, `false` otherwise (if you
are blocked by a wall)
//
* `move()`: moves one square forward if possible; otherwise does nothing
//
* `turnRight()`: turns right, does not change your position
//
* `turnLeft()`: turns left, does not change your position
//
* `isFinished()`: returns `true` when you have reached the end position

=== Evaluating Algorithms

As you begin implementing your maze escape algorithm, think about the different
ways that computer scientists evaluate algorithms.
//
Here are some of the components of a good algorithm:

. *It works.*
//
It should definitely solve the problem you are trying to solve, or at least have
a good probability of solving it in most cases.
//
. *It should perform well.*
//
It should not require a huge amount of resources to solve the
problem&mdash;whether those resources are time, computational horsepower,
computer memory, or disk space.
//
. *It should be understandable.*
//
Good algorithms are easy to understand and reason about.
//
The best ones are simple, and sometimes we even call them elegant.
//
Complex algorithms are hard to understand, making it difficult to think about
what they will do in certain cases.
//
. *The implementation should be clear and understandable.*
//
Many times we encounter algorithms while reading computer code.
//
So just as the algorithm must be clear, the implementation in computer code must
also be clear.
//
We will have a lot more to say about code quality throughout the
semester&mdash;particularly on the MPs.

These are not non-contradictory goals.
//
Frequently the desire for simplicity clashes with attempts to improve
performance, or handle all inputs correctly.
//
But particularly when you are starting off as a computer science, err on the
side of simplicity.
//
*Remember: computation is (increasingly) cheap, humans are expensive.*
//
If it takes me 10 times longer to understand or modify your algorithm, it is not
worth a only minor improvement in performance.
//
Let your algorithms waste a bit of computer time, but never human time.

=== Analyzing Your Algorithm

Once you have developed your algorithm, consider the following questions before
proceeding:

. *What are the limitations of your algorithm?*
//
Will it _always_ find its way out of _any_ maze, or just mazes with certain
properties?
//
. *How could you improve your algorithm?*
//
Would it help to keep track of other state, or have other operations (like
`moveRight()`) available to you?

=== Implementing Your Algorithm

[.lead]
//
Now let's _implement_ the maze solving algorithm that you designed in the first
half in Java.

Move over to the lab homework problem at this point.
//
Today's homework uses the CS 125 mazemaker Java library, which uses a
//
https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Maze_generation[well-known algorithm]
//
to automatically generate mazes.
//
You can find the
//
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/mazemaker[mazemaker source code]
//
and
//
https://cs125-illinois.github.io/mazemaker/[documentation]
//
on https://github.com/[GitHub]
//
footnote:[For the adventurous, there is also a
https://github.com/cs125-illinois/mazemaker.js[JavaScript] implementation that
we used for the Google Sheet maze.]
//
Note that the version used on the homework problem is bit different than what is
posted online, but largely the same.

==== Your algorithm's performance

Once you have a working algorithm, spend some time understanding its
performance.
//
Answer the following questions footnote:[You may want to start a new Google Doc
for this portion]:

. How many steps&mdash;each consisting of moving one square&mdash;does it take
to finish the maze?
//
Because the maze generation is random, you might want to run multiple trials and
average the results.
//
. For a maze with dimensions N by M, what is the _minimum_ number of steps
required to complete the maze, assuming you start at the bottom left and exit at
the top right?
//
. How much worse does your algorithm do? Why?
//
. Can you come up with ways to improve your algorithm?

==== Your algorithm's limitations

Now spend some time thinking about the _limitations_ of your algorithm.
//
In particular, the mazes that are generated by our maze creator all have
something in common: They have no loops!
//
This is due to the operation of the maze generation algorithm, which uses a
simple depth-first search over the two-dimensional space.
//
To make things more interesting, we could have inserted some holes at the
end&mdash;but we didn't.

But suppose you ran your algorithm on a maze with loops.
//
Think up one way it could get stuck.
//
So it's possible that your algorithm may not work!
//
But, assuming that the start and end point are always on the exterior wall of
the maze, try to convince your partner that your algorithm will still work.

=== A Randomized Algorithm

The maze-solving algorithm you implemented above is _deterministic_.
//
Provided the same maze, it will always navigate through it in the same way.
//
You may want to rerun your algorithm on the same maze a few times to convince
yourself of this.

Deterministic algorithms are great&mdash;easy to understand and reason about.
//
But there is a different class of algorithms called
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm[_randomized algorithms_].
//
As their name implies, these algorithms use randomness as part of their logic.
//
In some cases, this allows them to dramatically outperform the best known
deterministic algorithm.

One randomized algorithm that you may have seen in action is a space-filling
algorithm called a _random walk_.
//
If you've ever watched a Roomba footnote:[Or heard
http://www.theonion.com/article/roomba-violates-all-three-laws-of-roombotics-2184[its
horrible brushes at night...]], you've seen a random walk in action.
//
It turns out that mapping is a hard problem for robots to solve.
//
So, rather than trying to map an area, early robotic vacuums
//
footnote:[I think that some new ones
https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/neato-botvac-connected-review-a-lidar-powered-robot-vacuum-is-my-maid-now/[are
more sophisticated], although the cheap ones still work this way.]
//
just implemented a random walk:

. Go straight until you hit something
//
. Turn a random amount but sufficient to not continue into the obstacle
//
. Repeat

To a human observer this looks crazy&mdash;how is it ever going to get every
spot?
//
But it turns out that there is some fairly sophisticated mathematics that shows
that, given a certain number of passes, your random robot maid will get every
spot with very high probability.
//
Or at least chase a duck:

==== Implement a random walk

Inspired by your vacuum, try re-implementing your maze-solving algorithm using a
random walk.
//
More or less, here's how that works:

. Go forward until you are facing a wall
//
. Randomly turn right or left
//
. Repeat

Once you are done, compare the running time of your randomized algorithm with
the deterministic algorithm you implemented above.
//
Are you surprised?
//
With your partner, try to develop an explanation for the difference in
performance.
