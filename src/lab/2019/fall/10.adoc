//
This lab continues our discussion of recursion&mdash;a powerful new problem
solving tool.
//
You'll develop a recursive algorithm to explore a chess board and implement it
in Java.

== Recursion [.text-muted]#(50 Minutes)#

Recursion is an important and powerful programming tool.
//
In class we've seen recursion on trees, and will soon see the same idea applied
to lists and arrays.
//
At times, it can be the only way to elegantly solve a particular programming
problem.
//
But it is also a hard concept to wrap your head around.

=== The Knight's Tour

But today's lab introduces you to recursion on a _chess board_.
//
The problem we'll be solving today is a classic known as the
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour[Knight's Tour].
//
The goal is to visit _every_ square on a rectangular board _once_ using the
knight from chess, which moves in a distinctive
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)[L shape].
//
(Please review the Wikipedia article if you aren't familiar with chess or with
this particular piece&mdash;or ask a neighbor.)

This may seem like a strange problem to approach recursively.
//
But let's apply our usual strategy.

==== Base case

There are actually _two_ bases cases, one indicating success and one
indicating failure:

* *Success:* if we have successfully visited all squares we are done and can
stop.
//
* *Failure:* if we end up on a square where all moves would take us to squares
that we have already visited, we are stuck and _this particular_ path did not
work out.

==== Recursive step

How do we make the problem smaller?
//
Well, given an MxN board, a tour has to take M * N steps.
//
So if we take one move in any direction we are a bit closer to finishing the
tour!
//
Given a position on the board, we have several smaller subproblems to
solve&mdash;we need to see if we can visit all remaining squares from each of
our neighbors.
//
Since we have visited our current location, each subproblem also represents a
board with fewer squares to visit, and so a smaller problem.

==== Combine results

How do we combine results from multiple moves in different directions?
//
Here the idea is simple: just use the first direction that results in a valid
tour of the board.

==== Pseudocode

Before we start with our Java code let's jot down some pseudocode for our tour
algorithm:

[source]
----
if all squares are visited:
  return the board with the current successful tour
for all valid moves we can make:
  if the move takes us to a square we've visited:
    continue
  copy the current board
  make the move on the copied board
  restart the tour on the copied board
  if the tour completes succesfully:
    return that board
  otherwise:
    try the next move
if we reach here we didn't find a move that worked, so return failure
----

=== Open and Closed Tours

We can also distinguish between two kinds of Knight's tours.
//
An *open tour* can end anywhere.
//
But a closed tour has to link up with the start&mdash;meaning that it forms a
loop that the knight could continue forever footnote:[although you'd think that
they would get bored eventually...].

As a challenge problem on today's lab homework we'll have you try and implement
a _closed_ tour starting with your solution to the open tour algorithm.
//
It's not a huge change, but you may find it tricky.
