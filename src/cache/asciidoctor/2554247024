<p>An important part of Android development is to be able to test your work.
If you have an Android device, you can configure Android Studio to install your
test app onto it.
However, if you don&#8217;t have an Android device, or want to test on devices other
than ones that you own, you&#8217;ll need to utilize the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator.html">Android Emulator</a>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get a virtual device set up is to start a project, build it,
and then try to run it.
That will launch a dialog allowing you to configure a virtual device.
