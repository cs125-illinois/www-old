<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>This course is an introduction to the concepts and craft
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>
of computer science.
It will teach you to both <em>think</em> and <em>act</em> like a computer scientist.
It will change how you approach problems and provide you with powerful tools
that you <em>can</em> use to change the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer science is both an applied and a conceptual discipline.
You <em>will</em> learn how to program in this course.
Learning how to program effectively helps you bring your ideas to life.
It can be frustrating at first&mdash;computers are irritatingly literal
machines.
But programming is a skill, and like any other skill you will get better with
practice.
Computers are one of the most powerful tools that we have at our disposal to
solve almost any problem.
Learning how to get them to do your bidding is extremely empowering.
You will quickly come to understand the hackers lament.
Once you can program well, you can do anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while programming is both important and enjoyable, computer science also
has deep conceptual concerns at its core.
As a computer scientist, you&#8217;ll learn to design solutions to problems so that
computers can carry them out efficiently&mdash;we call these algorithms.
Being a computer scientist means coming up with new ways to solve problems
more effectively.
And then you get to build your solutions and can easily deploy them to
billions of people all over the world.
<strong>No other field has this potent mixture of left-brain analytics, right-brain
design and creativity, and the potential for global impact.</strong></p>

<h3 id="_preparation">1.3. Preparation</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>CS 125 assumes no prior knowledge of computer science or programming experience.
However, the course is a lot of work&mdash;and so is best suited to those who are
either majoring in computer science or have a strong interest in the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some students in CS 125 have no experience with computer science.
Others have been programming for years.
We will do our best to accommodate both groups.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_if_you_re_new_to_computer_science">1.3.1. If you&#8217;re new to computer science&#8230;&#8203;</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to the most exciting field on Earth!
We&#8217;re extremely happy to have you.
We know that it can be hard to get started, but trust us&mdash;you&#8217;ll get
better with practice.
Programming is a skill.
The more you do, the better you get.
If you&#8217;re willing to put in the time and energy, we&#8217;re here to help you
succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;re starting something new, it&#8217;s normal to occasionally feel
intimidated by those around you.
We were all new once, and most of us try new things at least once and a while.
So we know what it feels like.
Just remember that no matter how it may seem, there are a lot of other
students in CS 125 that are beginners too.
And if you&#8217;re working harder than some other students in the class, then it
just means that you&#8217;re learning more than they are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also keep in mind that computer scientists can get extremely excited about
what they know.
Our field is awesome, and we&#8217;re all learning new things all of the time.
Unfortunately, sometimes that can come off as arrogance or bragging.
But don&#8217;t let it get you down.
We want you to share in the excitement, and will do our best to make sure that
happens.</p>

<h4 id="_if_you_think_you_already_know_what_you_are_doing">1.3.2. If you think you already know what you are doing&#8230;&#8203;</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s so much more to learn!
No matter how much background in computer science you have, there are always
new areas to explore, new languages to learn, new problems to solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t find every aspect of CS 125 challenging, we hope that it can
continue to move you forward on your journey in computer science.
Keep in mind that continuing to develop as a programmer requires practice.
If the MPs don&#8217;t take you that long, then you aren&#8217;t getting the practice that
you need to keep improving.
You might want to join the <a href="http://cs196.xyz/">honors section (CS 196)</a>,
get involved with the
<a href="https://acm.illinois.edu/">Illinois Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</a>,
or just make sure that you have some side projects to keep you busy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And please feel free to help other students in the class that might not know
as much as you.
One of the best things about computer science is the community of generous and
patient people willing to help beginners get started.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student at the University of Illinois <strong>you are responsible for email sent
to your <code>@illinois.edu</code> email address.</strong>
We will occasionally use a course email list to send important announcements.
So messages in your inbox might say things like: "There&#8217;s a quiz tomorrow" or
"There&#8217;s a fire alarm in Siebel and class is canceled."
We all get too much email, but learning to manage it is a fact of modern life.
Feel free to talk to the course staff if you want tips.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student in CS 125 <strong>you are responsible for messages posted in the
<a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/spring-2018-announcements" class="noexternal">announcements
category of the forum</a>.</strong>
These announcements are important and we will frequently post in this category
in lieu of using email.
You can configure Discourse to send emails each time a topic is created in a
specific category.
We would suggest that you do that&mdash;or plan on visiting the forum each and
every day.

You may think that the professor spending five minutes responding to your email
is not a huge problem.
But five-minute responses to 600 students consumes <em>50 hours</em> of time, which is
about half of my entire work week.
You should also never contact a TA or doyen directly unless they have agreed to
this beforehand.
<em>Post on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not because we don&#8217;t like you or don&#8217;t like email.
It&#8217;s simply because there are a lot of you, a much smaller number of us, and
many of the questions that you have are shared by other students.
If you email us, we can answer your question to one person: you.
If you post on the forum, we can answer your question to the entire class.
And you may find that your question has already been answered, or that another
student can answer it for you.</p>

<h3 id="_estimating_your_letter_grade">4.3. Estimating Your Letter Grade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Letter grades in CS 125 are assigned based on how well <em>you</em> do, not based on
your performance relative to other students.
<strong>We have an unlimited number of A grades that we can hand out.</strong>
If everyone in the learns all of the material to our
satisfaction, everyone in the class will make an A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inevitably the difficulty of various parts of the course varies from semester to
semester.
So we do not determine the final grading scale until we examine all scores at
the end of the semester.
During the semester, do not ask us to estimate your grade or tell you how well
you need to do on an assignment to make a certain grade.
The fact that the final exam is worth 20% of your grade also makes it pointless
to try to project your final grade midway through the course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Instead, focus on learning the material to the best of your ability.</strong>
Programming in particular is a skill&mdash;the more you do, the better you get
at it.
So you should focus on doing as much as you need to get good at it, rather than
the minimum necessary to make a particular grade.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Programming is a skill.
Like other skills, the more you do it, the better at it you become.
The CS 125 <em>machine problems</em> (MPs)
<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_4" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>
are the primary way that you will learn the powerful skill of computer
programming&mdash;today&#8217;s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc&amp;t=81s">modern superpower</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Together the MPs are worth 45% of your grade&mdash;the largest grade component.
Working on them will deepen your understand of the material covered in lecture,
and improve your performance on the quizzes and final exam.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_how_to_complete_the_mps">5.1. How to Complete the MPs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CS 125 MPs are designed to take a significant amount of time.
So you should arrange your schedule so that you can devote a significant amount
of time on them.
<strong>Do not start the night before.</strong>
Not only will it be unlikely that you will complete the MP, but you will also be
unlikely to be able to get help when you get stuck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning to program is like learning other skills&mdash;how to play an
instrument, throw a perfect spiral, cook the perfect omelete, or learn another
<em>human</em> language.
You have to do it <em>every day</em>.
You can&#8217;t expect to complete a marathon or perform at Carnegie Hall if you start
practicing the night before.
As soon as each MP is released, sit down and spend a few hours on it.
And then do that the next day, and the day after that.
If you start early and work often, you will have no problem completing the MP
before the deadline.
If it turns out to be easy for you, you&#8217;ll be done early and can relax and help
other students.
If it turns out to be more difficult, you&#8217;ll know early on and be able to budget
your time according to complete it on time.
<strong>Nothing correlates more strongly with success on the MPs than starting
early.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="regrading">5.2. Late Submission Policy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is extremely important that you keep up with the MPs.
CS 125 moves quickly, and if you get behind early you will quickly find yourself
lost and unable to complete the later assignments.
<strong>This is the number one source of student lack of success in the course.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, the late submission policy is designed to reward students that do a
fair amount of work <em>before</em> the deadline.
Here are the details of the policy:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can submit <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_5" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_5" title="View footnote.">5</a>]</sup> each MP as many times as you want until
11:59:59 PM on Wednesday 5/2/2018.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late submissions can earn back 50% of any points lost by your best on-time
submission.
So if you submit code that earns 80/100 before the deadline, you will receive a
90/100 if you submit a perfect MP after the deadline.
If you submit code that earns 0/100 before the deadline, the best you can do is
a 50/100 with a perfect submission anytime after the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late submissions will not recover any starting the assignment on time points.
So if there were 10 starting the assignment on time points that you did not
earn, and your best score before the deadline was a 60/100, the best you can do
is a 75/100: half of the 30 points you missed that were not for starting the
assignment on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You will always receive the best score earned by any submission.</strong>
You can check your office MP scores

assigned MP (if any), and ask and answer questions on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a>.
If you engage with the course content on a daily basis, you will not need to
cram material right before you take the quiz.</p>

<h3 id="_missed_quizzes">6.3. Missed Quizzes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Do not contact the course staff regarding missed quizzes.</strong>
Because you have a several day window to complete each quiz, we expect that you
will be able to work around most other commitments and even short illnesses.
However, we will drop your <a href="#drops"><em>lowest 3 quiz scores</em></a> when computing the
quiz component of your final grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do miss a scheduled quiz and can retake it within the time window, you
can
<a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/contact.html">contact the CBTF to attempt to
reschedule</a>.
There are no guarantees though.
The CBTF is busy and they may not be able to accommodate you if you miss your
initial appointment.
The best approach is to not do that.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any problem with testing in the CBTF <strong>must be reported to CBTF staff at the time
the problem occurs.</strong>
If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test

<h3 id="_reporting_quiz_problems">6.5. Reporting Quiz Problems</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you believe that you have spotted a problem with a quiz question, please use
<a href="https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl">PrairieLearn&#8217;s</a>
built-in issue reporting to report the issue to the course staff.
Note that you have to be in the CBTF to access our quizzes and report problems.
At that point we will do one of the following things:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>If the question has a bug</strong>, we will fix it and ensure that all students receive
full credit&mdash;even those that took the quiz before the bug was identified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the question has a minor typo</strong> that we don&#8217;t think affects its
ability to be correctly answered, we will fix it and distribute that change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If the question is fine</strong> we will not do anything. Unfortunately, there is no
way for us to respond to your issue on PrairieLearn.
However, please keep in mind that your perception of the question&#8217;s correct
answer may be wrong&mdash;that&#8217;s the whole idea behind having the quizzes in the
first place.</p>

<h2 id="_exam_turing_s_craft_and_participation">7. Exam, Turing&#8217;s Craft, and Participation</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are fewer policies associated with these grade components, so we grouped
them together.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="exam">7.1. Exam</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>20% of your grade is earned through a single cumulative final exam at the end of
the semester.
More details about the exam will be released closer to the exam date.
You can find examples of previous exams and solutions <a href="/exams/">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="turings">7.2. Turing&#8217;s Craft</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>5% of your grade is earned by completing online programming exercises.
You can attempt these exercises as many times as you want, but we will drop
<a href="#drops"><em>5 sets of exercises</em></a> that you submit after the deadline.
Please see <a href="/info/resources/#turings">these instructions</a> that describes how
to register and earn credit for the Turing&#8217;s Craft coding problems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="participation">7.3. Lecture and Lab Participation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10% of your grade is earned by participating in lab section (5%) and lectures
(5%).
We will use several tools to track your participation in scheduled course
activities.
However, here are the ground rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You must participate in the lab or lecture that you are enrolled in.</strong>
CS 125 is always completely enrolled and so we have no space in other lab or
lecture sections.
If you attend the wrong lab or lecture, you will not receive participation
points.
Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participation is not attendance.</strong>
Just having your butt in the right seat at the right time does not constitute
participation.
In labs, you are expected to be working with your section on the lab activity.
In lecture, you are expected to follow along and engage with the material.
If you attend, but do not participate, you will not earn points for
participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You have several pre-excused absences.</strong>
You have <a href="#drops"><em>3 preexcused lab absences</em></a> and <a href="#drops"><em>10 preexcused
lecture absences</em></a>.
So if you need to miss a lab or lecture for any reason&mdash;illness, traveling,
personal issues, or anything else&mdash;there is no need to notify the course
staff.
If you miss a lab, feel free to attend
<a href="#labs">another lab section</a>, but you will not get lab participation points
for that week.
If you miss a lecture, just
<a href="/info/resources/#videos">watch the video online</a>
to review what you missed.
CS 125 moves fast, so don&#8217;t get behind!</p>

</ul>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="other">8. Other Policies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Below we summarize some other general course-related policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="cheating">8.1. Cheating</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Learning computer science requires hard work and practice.
If you submit code that is not your own work, or take other steps to subvert the
course policies, you are not getting the practice that you need to improve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>All work submitted for CS 125 must be your own.</strong>
Cheating in CS 125 may result in a grade reduction, your removal from the CS
program, or from the University of Illinois.
We have many bright, honest students that want to learn computer science.
We don&#8217;t need to waste time and energy on cheaters that don&#8217;t want to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifically, the following activities constitute cheating and will be dealt
with according to relevant
<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code">departmental</a>
and <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/">university policies</a>.
<strong>You may not</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Turn in work that was completed by anyone other than yourself.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy or paste code that you did not write</strong> from any source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misrepresent your work as the work of another student.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine another classmates solution</strong>, reproduce it, and submit it as your own
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share information about the content of quizzes or other course assessments.</strong>
Anyone caught removing information from the exam center will receive a letter
grade reduction and a FAIR violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publish your MPs or coursework anywhere where other students can find them.</strong>
Note that this includes publishing your MPs publicly on GitHub.
Nobody wants to see your solutions to the MPs anyway.
If you want to impress employers, fill your GitHub page with your own
independent projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We <em>will</em> run cheating detection software on all submitted student work.
These programs are extremely accurate, and any evidence of cheating that they
uncover will initiate academic integrity violation proceedings.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_simple_rule_of_thumb_about_collaboration">8.1.1. A simple rule of thumb about collaboration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A general rule of thumb is that exchanging or soliciting <em>ideas</em> about how to
solve the MP is not cheating, but exchanging code is cheating.
Feel free to discuss your solutions with other students as long as you do not
provide them or allow them to view your source code.
If you are talking in English <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_6" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_6" title="View footnote.">6</a>]</sup>,
that&#8217;s fine.
If you are talking or exchanging <em>computer code</em>, that&#8217;s cheating.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_penalties">8.1.2. Penalties</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>If you are caught cheating in CS 125 you will <em>definitely</em> receive a FAIR
violation.</strong>
Depending on the severity of the situation, you may also have any of the
following penalties applied:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A letter grade reduction in the class.
<strong>Note that this will likely make it impossible for you to transfer into the
Computer Science department.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An F in the course.
<strong>This will <em>definitely</em> make it impossible for you to transfer into the major.</strong></p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="extensions">8.2. Extensions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CS 125 is a fast-moving and demanding course.
You signed up to learn computer science and programming for 15 weeks, and we do
our best to give you your money&#8217;s worth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the consequences of this is that it is hard to catch up if you have a
significant illness or other problem mid-semester.
We will give extensions on the MPs and other assignments to accommodate
unforeseen short-term circumstances.
But if you are struggling with a larger issue, we may encourage you to withdraw
and enroll again next semester.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that, to receive an extension you should approach the course staff <em>before</em>
the relevant deadline.</strong>
Except in exceptional cases <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_7" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_7" title="View footnote.">7</a>]</sup> we will <em>not</em> grant requests for extensions or other
accommodations after the relevant deadline has passed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="accommodations">8.3. Accommodations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are more that happy to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
learning disabilities or other challenges.
<strong>However, we ask that you assist us by informing us of your situation as soon
as possible.</strong>
We will be much more accommodating of requests received <em>before</em> the relevant
assessment or deadlines, rather than after.
The earlier in the semester you can let us know what kind of help you need, the
better prepared we can be to provide it effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in many cases your letter of accommodation will <em>require</em> that you
request accommodations before or on the relevant deadlines.
If you fail to do so, we will not consider late requests.
Part of our job in ensuring that you&mdash;and every CS 125
student&mdash;succeeds in the course is keeping you on track throughout the
semester.
By the time the end of the semester rolls around, it is far to late to begin
asking for deadline extension and completing missed assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As far as our
<a href="#quizzes">quizzes in the CBTF</a>,
if you have accommodations identified by the
<a href="http://www.disability.illinois.edu/">Division of Rehabilitation-Education
Services (DRES)</a>
for exams, please take your Letter of Accommodation to the CBTF proctors in
person before you make your first exam reservation.
The proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF provides your accommodations
or whether you will need to make other arrangements with your instructor.</p>
