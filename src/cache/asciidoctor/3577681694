<p>Recursion is an important and powerful programming tool.
At times, it can be the only way to elegantly solve a particular programming
problem.
But it is also a hard concept to wrap your head around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today&#8217;s lab introduces you to recursion.
The written portion uses multiple simple examples to illustrate the concept, and
provides an opportunity to compare recursive and iterative solutions.
A big part of learning <em>how</em> to use recursion is learning <em>when not</em> to use it.
The programming component provides an opportunity to complete several simple
recursive functions on a small and useful graph.</p>

<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Recursion is hard to get started with, but it gets easier with
practice&mdash;like everything else you do as a programmer.
In the second half of the lab we&#8217;ll provide you with some practice at
implementing several recursive functions.
We&#8217;ll do this in the context of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)"><em>trees</em></a>
one of the more useful and interesting computer science data structures.</p>

<h3 id="_forking_and_cloning_the_lab8_intellij_project">2.1. Forking and Cloning the Lab8 IntelliJ Project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve set up an
<a href="https://github.com/cs125-illinois/Lab8">Lab 7 GitHub repository</a>
containing an IntelliJ Project that&#8217;s correctly configured for Lab 8.
Getting access to it is similar to how you
<a href="/MP/setup/git/#importing">imported MP0</a>.
But you have to fork our repository first.
If it&#8217;s not obvious how to do that, try following
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">these instructions</a>.</p>

<h3 id="_your_goal">2.2. Your Goal</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your goal today is to complete the <code>EmployeeDatabase.java</code> class.
There are some simple checkstyle errors to fix, but your main objective is to
complete two simple functions: one that counts <em>up</em> from a given employee, the
other that counts <em>down</em>.
As usual, you may find the official
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Lab8/">Lab8 documentation</a> helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both cases you are encouraged to complete both an iterative and recursive
solution to get a feeling for the design trade-offs involved.
When you are done, you may want to compare with another group, and discuss the
iterative-recursive trade-offs with them.
Do they feel the same way about their implementations as you do?</p>
