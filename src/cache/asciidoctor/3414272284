<p>Recursion is an important and powerful programming technique.
Sometimes it is the best way to solve a problem, and sometimes it is almost <em>the
only</em> way to solve a problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recursion can be tricky to wrap your head around at first, but as usual the best
way to get comfortable with this technique is to practice.
For MP5 you&#8217;ll complete several programming tasks that encourage you to consider
both recursive and iterative solutions.</p>

<p><strong>MP5 is due Monday 4/2/2018 @ 5PM.
To receive full credit, you must submit by this deadline.</strong>
In addition, 10% of your grade on MP5 is for submitting code that earns at least
<em>30 points</em> by <strong>Monday 3/26/2018 @ 5PM.</strong>
Note that this is the day after Spring Break, so we encourage you to get started
the week that MP5 is released.</p>

<h2 id="objectives">1. Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP5 introduces the concept of recursive programming and to working with linked
lists and object references.
You&#8217;ll learn how to complete simple recursive methods to accomplish common
programming tasks.
We also introduce you to binary trees, an important computer science data
structure and one very amenable to recursive approaches.
Finally, MP5 provides practice at working with linked lists, another important
computer science data structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll also continue to reinforce the learning objectives from previous MPs
(<a href="/MP/0/">0</a>, <a href="/MP/1/">1</a>, <a href="/MP/2/">2</a>, <a href="/MP/3/">3</a>, and
<a href="/MP/4/">4</a>).</p>

<h2 id="structure">2. Assignment Structure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP5 consists of three programming tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/SingleLL.html"><code>SingleLL.java</code></a>:
here you must extend complete several methods on a linked list class that stores
<code>int</code>s, including inserting, removing, and swapping values.
Consider this task a warm up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/Tree.html"><code>Tree.java</code></a>:
here you must create and complete a binary search tree class,
including adding constructors and insertion methods, along with methods that
search and perform computations on your tree.
This tasks contains the bulk of the points for the MP, so work on it once you&#8217;ve
finished <code>SingleLL.java</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/DNA.html"><code>DNA.java</code></a>:
for the final task you must complete a class that stores a DNA sequence and a
static method that computes the longest common subsequence of two DNA instances.
Longest common subsequence is the hardest algorithmic challenge on this MP, so
leave this for the end.
It&#8217;s only worth 10 points and you can consider it a challenge problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like <a href="/MP/4/">MP4</a>, MP5 provides a bit less scaffolding than previous MPs.
The official specification is our
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/">MP5 online documentation</a>.
It should precisely define what each public method in each class should do.
Private methods are left for you to design in any way that allows the tests to
pass.
If you believe that the documentation is unclear, please post on
the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/mps/mp5" class="noexternal">forum</a> and we&#8217;ll offer clarification as needed.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="approach">3. Approaching MP5</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Completing MP5 requires writing fewer lines of code than <a href="/MP/3/">MP3</a> and
<a href="/MP/4/">MP4</a>.
But some of it is <em>recursive</em> code, so it will take you longer.
Don&#8217;t expect to make as much progress writing recursive code when you are
getting started.
It&#8217;s tricky, and takes practice.
Slow down and focus on applying the recursive design principles that we&#8217;ve
taught in lecture and in lab.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_understand_the_requirements">3.1. Understand The Requirements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To complete MP5 you <em>must</em> understand the
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/MP5-Starter/">specification</a>.
Read that first.
And then read it again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_designing_recursive_functions">3.2. Designing Recursive Functions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recall the guidelines for designing recursive functions that we presented in lab
and lecture:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Every recursive function must have a base case.</strong>
If you don&#8217;t stop recursing, you will eventually run out of memory and
your program will crash.
So there must be some case where you do not call yourself again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The base case must be reached.</strong>
As a corollary to the above, every set of recursive calls must eventually
<em>reach</em> the base case, otherwise (again) your program will recurse infinitely,
run out of memory and crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The problem should get smaller each time.</strong>
Each recursive step should reduce the size of the problem somehow.
This can happen in several ways.
In Fibonacci, for example, we reduce the size of the problem by reduction toward
known staring values.
When processing trees, we reduce the size of the problem by splitting the tree
into several subtrees which are considered separately.
How this happens depends on the problem, but it does need to happen somehow.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can also be helpful to consider simple cases.
How do you reverse a list with only one element?
Now, extend that to a list with two elements, then three.
You may begin to see a pattern emerge that helps you understand how to design
your recursive approach.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="trees">3.3. Binary Search Trees</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>MP5 also introduces you to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree"><em>binary search trees</em></a>,
an important computer science data structure.
Binary search trees are also recursive data structures, in that each tree node
refers to other tree nodes, including a parent (moving up the tree) and two
children (down the tree).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like other data structures, binary search trees are useful because of the
algorithms that we can run on them.
As the name implies, searching can be particularly efficient on binary search
trees due to the way that they structure data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="insertion">3.3.1. Insertion algorithm</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many great online resources to help you learn about binary search trees.
But let&#8217;s consider one of the more basic tree operations: insertion.
Storing data in my tree requires that I be able to insert values.
And being able to efficiently search for values later requires that I perform
insertions in a particular way.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Start at the root of the tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the value that is being inserted with the value of the current node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is larger, try to move to the right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is smaller, try to move to the left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the current node has a left or right child (depending on the choice above),
make that the current node and continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise set the left or right child (depending on the choice above) of the
current node to a new node with the new inserted value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue until the node is inserted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the binary search trees you implement for MP5 can reject duplicate
values.
So if you reach a node that has the <em>same</em> value as the one you are trying to
insert, the insertion can fail.
However, this is an implementation decision, and you should think about how you
might store duplicate values if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you maintain the sorted structure during your insertions as described above,
the other algorithms that we ask you to complete on trees will be
straightforward.</p>
