//
The CS 125 App has been redesigned for the Fall 2019 semester.
//
It tracks the proximity of course staff and students to known course locations:
including office hours and Geoff's office.
//
Our app allows us to both understand how students use office hours and ensure
that we have staff available in office hours when needed.

**Note that the CS 125 App does not track your location without your consent.**
//
Our app uses BLE scanning to detect if you are in range of certain course locations,
such as office hours, or Geoff's office.
//
On Android, this BLE scanning causes a persistent notification to appear in your 
notification tray.
//
Since this persistent notification can be annoying, we provide an option to 
disable it footnote:[along with our BLE scanning].
//
If you choose to enable this option, we will periodically check your location to see
if you are within a certain distance to Siebel Center.
//
If you are outside of this distance, the app will disable BLE scanning and
the persistent notification will go away.
//
If you choose not to enable this option, we will not query your location and 
we will only know when you arrive and leave office hours, or Geoff's office.
//
We do not know footnote:[or care about] your location at other times.
//
Note that permission to perform this location checking can be granted or revoked at any time.

== Where to Get It

The CS 125 App is available for free footnote:[Duh] on both the
//
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.illinois.cs.cs125.app[Google
Play Store]
//
and the
//
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cs-125/id1425642647[Apple App Store].
//
(Note that there is an older app called "CS 125: Lecture Feedback". This is not
the right one to install or use. You can identify it because it does not have
the correct logo!)

[[bugs]]
== Bug Reports

The CS 125 App is beta software being built by a small team.
//
We do test changes on several devices before deploying new app versions, but
there are
//
https://qz.com/472767/there-are-now-more-than-24000-different-android-devices/[a
lot of different smartphones out there in the world].

So it may not work perfectly for you!

CS 125 course staff and students should report bugs
//
https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/bug-reports/cs-125-app-problems[on the
course forum].
//
(Non-CS 125 course staff and students should not be using this app.)

Note that while we are providing extra credit this semester for trying our new
app, *no part of your core grade in CS 125 is influenced by whether or not you
use our app.*

[[how]]
=== How It Works

Once you install the CS 125 App, satisfy the app requirements footnote:[provide
location permissions and enable Bluetooth and networking], and log in, the CS
125 App begins listening for signals sent by Bluetooth proximity beacons.
//
We have a set of beacons purchased from https://estimote.com/[Estimote].
//
They look like this:

image::https://estimote.com/assets/gfx/press/product/Proximity-Beacons-Group-Mint-Background.59b48af5.png[role='img-fluid']

When the app hears a signal from one of these beacons, it reports to our server
that you arrived at that location.
//
When it stops hearing that signal, it reports that you left.
//
**When it doesn't hear a signal from a beacon, and location checking is disabled, we don't know where you are.**

Estimote Bluetooth proximity beacons have
//
https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/201636913-What-are-Broadcasting-Power-RSSI-and-other-characteristics-of-a-beacon-s-signal-[a
range of up to 70 meters at full power]
//
but we have configured our beacons to transmit more softly and our app to only
detect signals within a radius of 10 meters.
//
You should notice that the app will detect our beacons in Siebel 0403 (office
hours) right as you walk in and lose the signal once you exit and turn the
corner into the basement hallway.

[[locations]]
=== Beacon Locations

Currently our app is configured to detect beacons in the following locations:

* *Siebel 0403*: there are two proximity beacons in the room we use to hold
office hours.
//
Both are mounted on a pillar in the middle of the room, one facing each
direction.
//
They are clearly visible&mdash;and hard to miss, given that they are purple.
//
* *Siebel 2227 (Geoff's Office)*: there is one proximity beacon in Geoff's
office.
//
And our CS 125 App allows you to determine when he's there if you want to stop
by.
//
Please do!
//
That's pretty much the point of this feature of the app.
//
However, note that this beacon _can be disabled_ by Geoff so he can "hide" in
his office if he's particularly busy footnote:[except that there are big
windows, making it pretty much impossible to effectively hide.].

You may see http://cs125.cs.illinois.edu/info/people/#developers[CS 125 Course
Developers] working with other beacons as they develop new features for the app,
but your app will not be configured to detect these beacons.

[[why]]
== Why Are We Doing This?

The CS 125 App allows us to monitor course staff and students as they arrive and
leave office hours.
//
We're doing this for two main reasons.

**First, it will help us better manage the course.**
//
We try to assign course staff to times that we think office hours will be busy,
but we don't really know when those times are.
//
So collecting this data and monitoring office hours in real time will help us
ensure that there are course staff available to help you when you need it.
//
**We never want you to come to office hours and not be able to get help!**
//
If we detect a particularly busy time or a particularly bad staff-to-student
ratio, we may put out an alert for extra course staff.
//
Geoff may even come down from his office to help.

**Second, it will help us understand the course and the effectiveness of office
hours.**
//
Getting space on campus for office hours is not always easy.
//
If we can show that they are effective, it will help us lobby for additional
space in the future.
//
We _suspect_ that students that come to office hours regularly&mdash;particularly
beginners&mdash;do better in CS 125.
//
Collecting this data will allow us to know for sure.

[[privacy]]
== Privacy Policy

The CS 125 App is for the exclusive use of CS 125 staff and students.
//
Although anyone with an `@illinois.edu` email address can log in, we only record
entry and exit events for current CS 125 staff and students.

All data collected by the CS 125 App is for exclusive use by the CS 125 Course
Staff and researchers at the University of Illinois.
//
It will not be shared with or in any other way provided to third parties.
//
Before using the data generated by the CS 125 App in any research publication,
even in aggregated form, we will obtain consent from app users.

All data collected by the CS 125 App is stored in secured servers located on
campus at the University of Illinois.
//
All data transfer back and forth between the app is done over encrypted
connections.
//
The app does not store your exact location, only if you are within a certain distance of Siebel Center.
//
The app only ever knows your current location.
//
The app also does not track your location when you are not logged in, so you are
welcome to only log on when you attend office hours and log off when you leave.
