        <h1>MP0: Target Mode</h1>
      <div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Welcome to the <strong>machine <em>project</em></strong>!
As described in
<a href="/info/syllabus#mp">the syllabus</a>,
the MP gives you practice applying your skills to a large project similar to the
ones you will work on in the future.
In this way it nicely complements the practice you get on the much smaller and
more contained homework problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So while much of this first checkpoint involves writing small pieces of code
similar to recent homework problems, you&#x2019;ll be integrating them into a large
software project: a complete Android app.
When you&#x2019;re done the app will do something new and cool as the result of your
efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overall machine project (MP) is broken down into individual <em>checkpoints</em>.
We&#x2019;ll refer to them like this: MP0 for the first checkpoint, or MP4 for the
fifth checkpoint
<span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;You&amp;#x2019;re a computer scientist now&amp;#x2014;and we start numbering at zero.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">1</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<a class="anchor" id="gettingstarted"></a><h2>1. Getting Started with MP0</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>In MP0 you&#x2019;ll begin transforming the <a href="#app">Spring 2020 CS 125 App</a> into a fun
and fully-working game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For MP0 you&#x2019;ll turn the starter code into a single player version of a target
mode game on some targets we&#x2019;ve selected with a constant proximity threshold.
A complete description of the <a href="#app">CS 125 Spring 2020 App</a> follows below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="deadline"></a><h3>1.1. MP0 Deadline and Deadline Groups</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Deadlines for each checkpoint vary based on your deadline group.</strong>
The first checkpoint (MP0) deadline is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>11:59PM on Sunday 2/16/2020 for the Blue Team</strong>, all labs starting at 3PM or
earlier (9, 10, 11AM, 12, 1, 2, and 3PM)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>11:59PM on Monday 2/17/2020 for the Orange Team</strong>, all labs starting at 4PM or
later (4, 5, 6, 7, and 8PM)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, 10% of your grade on MP0 is for submitting code that earns at least
<em>40 points</em> by 11:59PM on <strong>Sunday 2/9/2020 (Blue)</strong> or <strong>Monday 2/10/2020
(Orange)</strong>.
Late submissions will be subject to the MP
<a href="/info/syllabus#regrading">late submission policy</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_learning_objectives"></a><h3>1.2. Learning Objectives</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core objectives of MP0 are both to keep you practicing writing
simple functions <strong>and</strong> to get you started working with Android.
Specifically, this checkpoint trains you to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>work with variables and arrays of appropriate types</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform simple operations on numeric values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use simple loops and conditional statements to process data in arrays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>translate specifications into working code, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work with test suites as part of your development process.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_assignment_structure"></a><h3>1.3. Assignment Structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The machine project is a single Android app that you will continuously improve
throughout the semester.
Like all Android apps, it consists of Java code plus Android-specific resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moderate-to-large software projects organize their code into multiple Java code files.
You&#x2019;ll typically only work with a few to complete each checkpoint.
Some you won&#x2019;t need to modify at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the points on MP0 come from implementing well-defined Java functions
like you&#x2019;re starting to do on the homework.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Connecting those to the game to make the app start to work takes less code, but
you will need to spend some time looking over the code we&#x2019;ve provided as you get
oriented.
We&#x2019;ve included some helpful comments to summarize what&#x2019;s going on and point you
in the right direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the comments in the files you need to work with should explain everything
you need to know, you can also examine our official
<a href="https://cs125-illinois.github.io/Spring2020-MP-Writeups/0/overview-summary.html" target="_blank" class="external">online documentation</a>
if you&#x2019;re curious what each function and class does.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_android_studio_setup"></a><h3>1.4. Android Studio Setup</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before starting the MP you must complete
<a href="/MP/setup/android-studio">setting up Android Studio</a>
and have either an emulator or real device that you can run Android apps on.
If you are struggling with this, please come to office hours for help&#x2014;or
post on the forum
<a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/spring2020-mp/androidstudio/91" target="_blank" class="external">in the Android

<a class="anchor" id="android"></a><h3>2.1. Intro to Android</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Android is a Java-based framework for building smartphone apps that run on the
Android platform.
By learning how to build Android apps, your programs can have enormous impact.
Last year Google estimated that there were
<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/05/07/there-are-now-more-than-2-5-billion-active-android-devices/" target="_blank" class="external"><strong>2.5
billion</strong></a>
active Android devices.
That&#x2019;s one out of three people <em>on Earth</em>&#x2014;and
<a href="https://fortune.com/2017/03/06/apple-iphone-use-worldwide/" target="_blank" class="external">several times more
than iOS</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Android is also a huge and complex system.
<strong>It&#x2019;s normal to feel lost when you are getting started.</strong>
Our best advice is to just slow down, take a deep breath, and try to understand
a bit of what is going on at a time.
We&#x2019;ll try to walk you through a few of the salient bits for MP0 below and in
comments in the starter code.
Google also maintains a great set of tutorials on
<a href="https://developer.android.com/courses/fundamentals-training/overview-v2" target="_blank" class="external">beginning
Android development</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that you will use Android for all of the MP this semester and for your
final project</strong>, so put in some time to familiarize yourself with it now.
It&#x2019;s simply the best way to build exciting things&#x2014;programs that you can
share with your friends and family, and that might just change the world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_understanding_the_coordinate_system"></a><h3>2.2. Understanding the Coordinate System</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the app is a location-based game, it will be useful for you to understand
location coordinates, especially when testing your app on a phone or emulator.
Digitizing a position on the Earth turns a location into numbers that computers
can manipulate, and is what gave rise to smartphone-based navigation, ride
sharing, and self-driving cars.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locations are expressed as latitude-longitude (sometimes called &quot;lat-long&quot; or
<code>LatLng</code>) pairs.
You&#x2019;ll often see them written as comma-separated coordinate pairs, longitude
first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Latitude</strong> is defined relative to the Earth&#x2019;s equator and specifies how far
north or south you are.
<strong>Longitude</strong> is defined relative to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian" target="_blank" class="external">Prime Meridian</a>
and specifies how far east or west you are.
One increment of longitude is <em>not</em> the same physical distance as the same
increment of latitude.
The distance between adjacent meridians (a change of 1 in longitude) is
different at different latitudes.
At the small scales we&#x2019;ll be working with, however, the curvature of the Earth
can be ignored.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Campus Snake teams compete to capture real-world objectives by visiting them
before opposing teams.
The objectives may be specific locations&#x2014;<strong>target mode</strong>&#x2014;or cells on an
evenly spaced rectangular grid&#x2014;<strong>area mode</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there&#x2019;s a twist: the <em>snake rule</em>.
After a player has captured multiple objectives, the path between them forms a
line.
<strong>These paths are not allowed to intersect.</strong>
Visiting a target will not claim it if doing so would add a line that crosses an existing line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In target mode, the <em>proximity threshold</em> is how close a player must get to a
target to capture it.
When the app is finished, players and observers in a game will be shown a map
depicting claims and players&apos; locations.
A game creation screen will allow specifying the objectives and inviting
participants.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">

<p>When you&#x2019;ve finished Checkpoint 0, the app should display a marker on the map at
each target&#x2019;s position.
When the user moves within the proximity threshold of a target and it can
claimed without violating the snake rule, the target should turn green.
Capturing a target should add a green line between it and the previously
captured target&#x2014;if it exists.</p>

<p><code>isTargetWithinRange</code>: given a target, determines whether that target is

existing line between two previously claimed targets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>visitTarget</code>: updates a path array to reflect that a specified target has
been visited, returning the updated index of the array</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When your helper functions are ready, you can use them to make the app do
something.</p>
</div>

<p>The only test suite you&#x2019;ll see right now is <code>Checkpoint0Test</code>. Each test suite contains several test functions, each of which tests one aspect
of your app.
For example, our <code>testVisitTarget</code> function verifies the correctness of your
<code>visitTarget</code> function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use the test suites to perform iterative test-driven development.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Start with one graded task that you need to accomplish&#x2014;for example,
implementing <code>isTargetVisited</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the current checkpoint&#x2019;s test suite, &quot;Test Checkpoint 0,&quot; from the dropdown
at the top near the green run button.
Tests for parts you haven&#x2019;t started working on yet should fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin working on the function. When you think you have a solution, re-run the test suite.
You can run just one test by using a run button in the left margin of a test suite&#x2019;s code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the test suite succeeds, you&#x2019;re <strong>almost</strong> done&#x2014;congratulations!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make sure to run the full autograder to ensure you got all the points you expected.
There are a few points for code style, described further below.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a test suite fails, try to diagnose the problem by looking at what inputs
caused your function&#x2019;s behavior to diverge from what was expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your app didn&#x2019;t crash but produced incorrect results, the error will say what it expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your code crashed, the error message will show what problematic operation was
attempted and what line of your code directly caused it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Either way, the error message also includes what line of the test suite was
reached when the problem was hit.
You&#x2019;re not expected to fully understand the test suites, but reading their code
may provide some clues about what&#x2019;s going on in the case that your submission
fails.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, <strong>the fewer lines of code you write before running a test, the
better.</strong>
This is not just a rule for beginners&#x2014;experienced programmers spend a lot
of time writing tests, in fact probably more than when they were learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you are starting out, it is easy to introduce bugs into your code.
Bugs are easiest to catch one-by-one, and so the fewer lines of untested code,
the more likely you are to identify errors in your logic or implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock alert alert-warning">
<div class="content">

<a class="anchor" id="_compile_errors"></a><h3>3.5. Compile Errors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before a program can be run, it must be compiled from your source code into
something that can be executed.
We&#x2019;ll talk a <em>bit</em> more about this later in the semester.
Problems in this stage are <strong>compile errors</strong>, indicating that your code has a
mistake&#x2014;often a syntax error&#x2014;that makes Java unable to understand or
permit what you&#x2019;re trying to do.
They&#x2019;re flagged with red squiggles in the code editor or shown in a window like
this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/MP/images/MP0/compileerror.png" alt="Example compiler error">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several kinds of errors you may encounter as you work on the project. Distinguishing between them will help you fix them.
Remember: programmers <em>never</em> stop making mistakes. They just get better at fixing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can usually double-click the error to jump to the code where Java identified
the problem.
However, unbalanced curly braces can make Java think the structure of your code
is very different than you intended.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you suddenly receive tons of compile errors, look <strong>before</strong> the start of the
problems to see if you have an extra or missing curly brace.
This is one of many things that proper indentation helps with.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_runtime_errors"></a><h3>3.6. Runtime Errors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If compilation succeeds but the program tries to do something impossible or
disallowed, that&#x2019;s a crash&#x2014;a <strong>runtime error</strong>.
The test output pane marks the crashed test with a red icon and tells you went
wrong and what line of code caused the crash.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="/MP/images/MP0/runtimeerror.png" alt="Example runtime error">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line states the problem, in this case that code tried to access the
out-of-bounds index <code>-1</code> of an array.
What follows is called a <strong>stack trace</strong>.
The direct cause of the crash is at the top&#x2014;in this case the
<code>isTargetVisited</code> method of <code>TargetVisitChecker</code>&#x2014;and the rest of the
stack trace describes how the code reached this point.
Helpfully, the stack trace also includes the line number of the code that
crashed.
You can click the underlined link to jump right to that line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other lines are the chain of function calls that led to the crashing
function.
In this case, <code>isTargetVisited</code> was called by line 289 in
<code>Checkpoint0Test</code>&apos;s <code>invoke</code> function, which was called by an <code>access$300</code>
function attributed to line 285 <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;which is synthetic and doesn&amp;#x2019;t appear in the source code&amp;#x2014;don&amp;#x2019;t worry about this&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">2</span>, which was called by line 302
in <code>testIsVisited</code>.
Usually you want to investigate the first stack trace entry that mentions your
code, but finding what the test suite was trying to check when your code crashed
may also provide some clues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you continue to write more complex code, stack traces will frequently lead
you from the place where the problem manifested itself to the real cause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, it&#x2019;s common for code to cause no crashes but produce incorrect results.
When these <strong>logic errors</strong> are detected, the test output pane marks the failed
test with a yellow icon and displays a report similar to one from a crash.
However, since your code finished executing but just returned a wrong result,
only the test code which found the problem will be on the stack trace.
Often the message will specify the expected (correct) value and the actual (your
code&#x2019;s incorrect) value.
You can jump to the complaining line of the test suite to get more context and
see what call(s) it made to your code.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Automated testing is a hugely important part of modern software development.
Just like computers are good at running programs, they are also good at running
programs to debug other programs.
Independently developing a method and the function that tests it allows the two
to support each other.
The test may find errors in the method, and the method may also identify errors
in the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Testing simple Java functions is relatively straightforward: we invoke your code
with some chosen inputs and compare the output to the known-correct result.
Testing Android UIs, however, is more difficult.
This semester we will use
<a href="http://robolectric.org/" target="_blank" class="external">Robolectric</a>
to test your app code in a Java environment that simulates Android.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the first checkpoint we test each of the three helper functions with some
simple manually designed test cases, <strong>then</strong> exhaustive test cases using many
randomly generated inputs.
Since each test function stops as soon as it detects a problem, we placed the
simple cases first so you can use them during iterative development.
In particular, some simple cases in <code>testSnakeRule</code> have diagrams that visually
show why the expected answer is correct.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have provided you with a local autograder that you can use to estimate your current grade
on your own machine as often as you want.
Your Android Studio project contains a run configuration
called &quot;Grade&quot; that will run the autograder for the current checkpoint.
You can also run the grader by installing
<a href="/MP/setup/android-studio#cs125plugin">our plugin</a>
and then pressing the button that looks like the CS 125 shield.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock alert alert-warning">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before your grade your checkpoint you will need to identify yourself by entering
your <code>@illinois.edu</code> email address into the <code>email.txt</code> file located in the root
project directory.
The autograder will not run until you do this.
<strong>Please make sure to get this right!</strong>
If you don&#x2019;t, your results will not be visible on the grading page, and may be
attributed to another student&#x2014;putting you at risk of an academic integrity
violation.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you have modified the test suite or autograder configuration,
the autograding output should approximate the score that you will earn when you submit.
If you modify our test cases or the autograding configuration, <strong>all bets are off</strong>.
You may also lose points if your solution runs too slowly and exceeds the testing timeouts.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_style_points"></a><h3>4.3. Style Points</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the points on each checkpoint are for correctly implementing the required functions.
The other 10 points are for <strong>style</strong>.
Writing readable code according to a style guideline is
extremely important, and we are going to help you get into this habit right from the start.
All software development companies and most active open-source projects maintain style guidelines.
Adhering to them will help others understand and integrate your contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have configured the <code>checkstyle</code> plugin to enforce a variant of the
<a href="https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/sun_style.html" target="_blank" class="external">Sun coding style</a>.
Android Studio should naturally produce formatting that meets this standard.
So you shouldn&#x2019;t have to fight with it too much to avoid <code>checkstyle</code> violations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For ease of finding style problems, Android Studio flags them with red squiggles
under code and with red tick marks on the scrollbar.
You can hover your mouse over such indicators to get more details on what
<code>checkstyle</code> is complaining about.
You will also get a full list of <code>checkstyle</code> errors at the top of the grading
output.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may find these requirements a bit annoying at first, but we trust that you will get used to them.
Once you build good style habits, you won&#x2019;t have to think about them anymore,
and will just go on writing beautiful code.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After completing MP0 you may be thinking that dealing with locations as multiple
arrays is unwieldy.
You&#x2019;re right!
You&#x2019;ll soon learn a better way to handle pieces of related data, and in a future
checkpoint you&#x2019;ll revisit the code you wrote here to apply that technique.
And of course there are plenty of other new features to implement, like area
mode which we&#x2019;ll tackle next checkpoint.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_complete_app_demo"></a><h3>5.1. Complete App Demo</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can&#x2019;t wait to see how the app will work when you&#x2019;re done with the MP, you
can set our module manager to use all of our provided libraries.
There&#x2019;s a file called <code>grade.yaml</code> in the root of the project that will be used
in later checkpoints to indicate what you&#x2019;re currently working on, but if you
change its <code>checkpoint</code> setting from <code>0</code> to <code>demo</code> and its <code>useProvided</code> setting
from <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> then do <strong>File | Sync Project with Gradle Files</strong>, building
and running the app will produce our solution.
(The Gradle sync step is important! Without that, very strange behavior will
occur.)
Make sure to change those settings back and Gradle sync again before trying to
grade or submit, since you don&#x2019;t get points for grading our known good solution.</p>
