        <h1>MP5: Final Project</h1>
      <div class="paragraph lead">
<p>You&#x2019;ve learned a lot this semester.
Now it&#x2019;s time to try out your newly-acquired super powers.
MP5 is not about us giving you something to do&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about you
accomplishing something <em>you want</em> to do using computer science.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP5 is different than previous MPs.
It is done in pairs with a partner from your lab section.
And it&#x2019;s due in your lab section during the last week of class: so during lab on
<strong>Tuesday 12/10/2019</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#x2019;re also giving you a chance to earn <a href="#extra">extra credit</a> by doing a great
project <em>and</em> participating in our fourth biannual Final Project Fair: Thursday
12/12/2019 afternoon throughout Siebel
<span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Exact time forthcoming.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">1</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<a class="anchor" id="objectives"></a><h2>1. Learning Objectives</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the Machine Project had you execute a carefully-planned route from point A
to point B, the Final Project takes you on a journey off the map.
You&#x2019;ll learn how to plan and execute a small Android project of your own design.
You&#x2019;ll also learn how to work with a partner.
All the skills you learned in the MP checkpoints will continue to be useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many ways, the Machine Project has been designed to prepare you for this
moment.
The Final Project brings everything together and starts you out on a career as
an independent software developer&#x2014;working on your own projects and
learning things that interest you.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<a class="anchor" id="rules"></a><h2>2. Rules</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our goal in MP5 is to give you as much flexibility as possible, so there are few
rules about what you can and can&#x2019;t do.
But those that we do have are important:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You <em>must</em> do something new for MP5.
Do not submit something from another class, or something you&#x2019;ve done previously.
You may want to work on something that you&#x2019;ve started on previously, but given
that you&#x2019;ll be working with a partner that&#x2019;s not fair to them.
So you should pick something new to do for MP5.
It doesn&#x2019;t have to be a huge project&#x2014;you only have a few weeks.
But it should be original work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are the rest of the rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You need to build an Android app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to design a simple UI. We&#x2019;ll provide help with that in lab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to finish a UI mockup by the week before the final due date and show it in lab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to use a new web API, software library, or Android feature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to commit your work to version control&#x2014;to either a public or private repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to work with someone in your lab section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You cannot build a weather app or a calorie counter.</strong> We&#x2019;ve seen too many of those recently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Other than that, what to do is up to you.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we did <em>not</em> say that your Android app has to be written in Java.
The adventurous among you may want to try out
<a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin" target="_blank" class="external">Kotlin</a>,
which is now Google&#x2019;s preferred language for Android development.
And the even more adventurous among you may want to give cross-platform app
development a try using a framework like
<a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/" target="_blank" class="external">React Native</a>.
The goal here is to learn something new, so these kinds of adventures are not
discouraged.
However, keep in mind that on a whole the course staff will be less helpful if
you choose to use a language or framework they are less familiar with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You turn in the Final Project by recording a YouTube presentation which will be shown in lab
during the last week of class.
You and your partner should plan that together.
<strong>You <em>do</em> have to publish your work on GitHub (or GitLab, or something
similar)&#x2014;privately if you want.</strong>
So you should set up your project using Git and be able to show that you have
committed and pushed your code to GitHub as part of your turn-in presentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="partnering"></a><h3>2.1. Partner Rules</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Final Project is done in <strong>groups of two</strong> <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;A single group of three is acceptable in some circumstances, for example if your lab has an odd number of students. Your TA&amp;#x2019;s approval is required to form a group of three.  We will expect proportionately more of apps made by a group of three than pairs.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">2</span>.
Obviously you want to find someone to work with that you enjoy working with and
think that you can do an awesome project with&#x2014;since we will be giving
extra credit for some of the best projects.
You will also want to make sure that at least one of you has a laptop that can
smoothly run Android Studio and the emulator, or an Android phone for demoing
your new application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would like to work with someone from another lab section, <em>you must both
attend the lab together for the remaining three labs</em>.
This means that either one of you will receive participation credit for that
lab, or you&#x2019;ll need to attend two labs: one for each partner.
Since our remaining labs are pretty much entirely set aside for Final Project
work time, attending two labs isn&#x2019;t the end of the world.
<strong>But you will not receive credit for working in lab without your partner.</strong>
If you want to work with someone from another lab, this is the tradeoff you will
have to make.
(Remember that you have three excused lab absences.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should find a partner by the end of the 11/19/2019 lab.
There is a UI checkpoint in the lab after Thanksgiving, and you will start
losing credit quickly if you don&#x2019;t have a partner.
Use the forum to find one if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="openblock alert alert-warning">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We expect you to work in pairs. Projects completed by larger groups without TA approval,
or by individuals, will not be graded.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="ui"></a><h3>2.2. UI Checkpoint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second-to-last lab, on Tuesday 12/3/2019, will be dedicated to you showing your
TA the progress you&#x2019;ve made so far. By then, you should have at least a mockup of
your app&#x2019;s user interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The app&#x2019;s functionality doesn&#x2019;t need to work yet, but you should have set up
much of the UI in your layout resource(s).
Pressing buttons should trigger <em>something</em>, even if that&#x2019;s just writing to the
Logcat to show that you&#x2019;ve attached handler stubs that will be implemented
later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that your app must have an interface that the user can interact with.
Apps that only run in the background or exit immediately do not qualify.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<a class="anchor" id="help"></a><h2>3. Help and Tips</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the Final Project is self-driven, please feel free to approach the course
staff for help.
Post on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/fall2019-mp/final-project" class="noexternal">forum</a>, or come to office hours and discuss your project idea and
implementation with the course staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="libraries"></a><h3>3.1. Using Libraries</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To use features and classes provided by a software library, you need to add it
to your project.
Many Java libraries are published to repositories that Gradle&#x2014;the most
common Android build system&#x2014;can access.
You can have Gradle install a library into your project by adding the library&#x2019;s
<em>dependency coordinate</em> to the <code>dependencies</code> section of your Gradle
buildscript, the <code>build.gradle</code> file inside the <code>app</code> folder of your project.
The library&#x2019;s web page will probably include the line you can add to your
buildscript.
It will usually look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-groovy spelling_exception lang-groovy" data-lang="groovy">implementation &apos;com.android.volley:volley:1.1.1&apos;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>implementation</code> directive means that the library is used by your app, as
opposed to used only by tests or only needed at compile time.
The string inside the quotes is the dependency coordinate.  Here,
<code>com.android.volley</code> is the <em>group</em>, <code>volley</code> is the <em>artifact</em>, and <code>1.1.1</code> is
the <em>version</em>.
Gradle accepts multiple ways of identifying a dependency, so you might see other
formats too.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some libraries&apos; web sites might also provide instructions for downloading the
library code and manually adding it as a module to your project.
This is usually <em>not</em> what you want.
If possible, find a dependency coordinate and install the library using Gradle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If the library isn&#x2019;t published in a way that allows you to import it using
Gradle, then we might advise you to steer clear anyway.
This is a sign of an old or poorly-maintained library.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To learn how to use a specific library, refer to its documentation or search the
Internet for examples.
While the course staff are happy to help you look for resources, they have not
used every possible library.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="webrequests"></a><h3>3.2. Making Web Requests</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using a web API for your app, you will need some way to make web
requests.
While there are several HTTP libraries for Android, we recommend the
<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html" target="_blank" class="external">Volley</a> library.
It is very similar to the <code>WebApi</code> component we provided with the Machine
Project <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;In fact, the HTTP parts of &lt;code&gt;WebApi&lt;/code&gt; are a wrapper around Volley with a little extra work for integration with Firebase Authentication and Gson.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">3</span>.
Android provides <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/volley/simple.html" target="_blank" class="external">an
introduction to using it</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All Volley requests are processed by a <code>RequestQueue</code>.
You can make just one queue per activity <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;or per app, though be careful with &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; in Android&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">4</span> and use it for multiple requests.
To make a request, first instantiate a request object like a <code>StringRequest</code>.
The request object specifies the HTTP method, URL, response handler, error
handler, and possibly POST data depending on the request class.
Start the request by passing it to a queue&#x2019;s <code>add</code> method. Some time in the
future, your response or error handler will be called.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>StringRequest</code>s give you raw string responses, but many web APIs return JSON.
You can use <a href="https://github.com/google/gson" target="_blank" class="external">Gson</a>&apos;s <code>JsonParser</code> to turn the
string into a Gson object <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Gson even has ways to parse JSON into instances of your custom Java classes.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">5</span>.
You could alternatively use Volley&#x2019;s
<a href="https://javadoc.io/static/com.android.volley/volley/1.1.1/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonObjectRequest.html" target="_blank" class="external"><code>JsonObjectRequest</code></a>
or
<a href="https://javadoc.io/static/com.android.volley/volley/1.1.1/com/android/volley/toolbox/JsonArrayRequest.html" target="_blank" class="external"><code>JsonArrayRequest</code></a>
to have the text parsed for you, albeit into a different kind of Java object
than you used for the Machine Project.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="github"></a><h3>3.3. Publishing to GitHub</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Android Studio can help you put your project on GitHub.
The <em>VCS | Import into Version Control | Share Project on GitHub</em> menu command
will start a process to create a GitHub repository and upload the contents of
your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To give your partner write access to the repository, add them as a collaborator
by opening the repository on the GitHub web site, going to the Settings tab,
selecting the Collaborators section, and adding them.
Your partner can clone the repository onto their computer, make changes, and
push just like you can.
You will want to pull (<em>VCS | Git | Pull</em>) before starting a work session so
that you can get any changes made by your partner.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="grading"></a><h2>4. Grading</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Final Project grading is quite generous.
We care that you tried something new, not that you succeeded fully your first time.
It is worth 100 points total, broken down as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>20 points</strong> for building an original <em>and working</em> Android app</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>20 points</strong> for the first UI checkpoint, shown in lab on 12/3/2019</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>20 points</strong> for using a new web API, software library, or Android feature</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10 points</strong> for ensuring that all team members have roles in the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>20 points</strong> for recording your YouTube video</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10 points</strong> for properly publishing your work to a version control site like GitHub</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike the Machine Project, there is no autograding or online testing for the
Final Project.
Grades are entirely at the discretion of the course staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Also note that the Final Project cannot be dropped.</strong>
It&#x2019;s too important&#x2014;this is your chance to do something cool, creative, and
to show us everything you&#x2019;ve learned this semester.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="extra"></a><h3>4.1. Final Project Fair and Extra Credit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>MP5 also provides an opportunity to earn extra credit by participating in our CS
125 Final Project Fair.
We are providing extra credit as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1%</strong> increase in your final CS 125 grade for participating in the final
project fair, Thursday 12/12/2019 in Siebel <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;Time to be announced, but probably late afternoon.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">6</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1%</strong> increase in your final CS 125 grade if your project is judged to be one
of the most impressive.
Note that <em>we will take into account your level of ability when you started CS
125</em> when determining how impressive your project is.
So this is open to students of all ability levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1%</strong> increase in your final CS 125 grade if one of the projects from <em>your
lab</em> is judged to be most impressive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The maximum extra credit is 2%: if you participate in the fair and
either have one of the most impressive projects or are in a lab that has one.
Put another way, if you have one of the most impressive projects you don&#x2019;t get
an extra 1% from the lab incentive.
This extra credit is independent from any previous extra credit that
you might have earned earlier this semester.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="submitting"></a><h2>5. Submitting Your Work</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You and your partner must prepare a presentation of at most <em>4 minutes</em> for the last lab
section during the final week of class.
<strong>You will not give the presentation live during your lab section.</strong>
Instead, you should prerecord your presentation and upload it to YouTube.
The video will be shown in lab on 12/10/2019.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your presentation should cover what you did, why you did it, who did what, and
any other interesting details: interesting technical problems you encountered,
how you collaborated, or ideas for future work.
You should also confirm that this was an original project and that it was
published under one or both of the project partners&apos; accounts.
We have very limited lab time, so do not feel pressured to use all four minutes.
If you can demo your project and discuss it sufficiently in less time, that&#x2019;s great!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will post a form after break that you can use to submit details about your
final project.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="cheating"></a><h3>5.1. Academic Integrity</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any attempt to turn in non-original work will be treated as an academic integrity violation.
Having someone else do your project for you or copying an existing codebase are forbidden.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in the real world it is very common to get <em>some</em> help with projects
from other people or online sources.
You are free to show some code from your final project on the public <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/fall2019-mp/final-project" class="noexternal">forum</a> or
copy-paste snippets of code from programming web sites.
If you use substantial snippets from outside sources, it can be good practice to
include the URL in a comment above the code that you borrowed.
This serves both to acknowledge the source and to remind you where it came from
in case you or your partner is trying to debug or understand it.
If in doubt, ask the course staff.</p>
