<p><strong>The Covid-19 pandemic has canceled in-person instruction at the University of
Illinois for the Spring 2020 semester.</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CS 125 has transitioned to an online format.
This has resulted in the following changes to our course policies and
procedures:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Class</strong> will now be live-streamed on YouTube Monday and Friday at 10AM and
Wednesday at 11AM.
Students are encouraged to join the live stream and follow along, but class
participation will not be counted for the remainder of the semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Quizzes</strong> will now be held synchronously on Wednesday during class time:
from 10&#x2013;10:50AM CDT.
Students who are in substantially different time zones may request to take the
quiz at an alternate time.
Students with poor internet access may request more time to complete the
assessment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labs</strong> will be held virtually using video chat.
Lab staff will be available during normal lab hours: from 9AM to 9PM CDT.
Lab activities will remain available for the entire day.
Lab participation will not be counted for the remainder of the semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Office Hours</strong> will continue to be run at the usual time but held using the
new
<a href="https://cs125-help.cs.illinois.edu" target="_blank" class="external">CS 125 Help System</a>.
Students needing assistance are also encouraged to use the course <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a> to ask
for help.
Remember that if you need to share source code you can message the
<code>Spring2020-Help</code> group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Final Project Fair</strong> is canceled.
However, the final project will continue as scheduled, including assessment
in lab during the final week of class.
Projects deemed impressive will still be highlighted on the
<a href="/info/fair">project fair page</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the exception of the changes listed above, CS 125 will go forward as
planned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, we will also make the following grading accommodations:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>We have added an MP checkpoint drop, and increased the number of quiz drops
from 2 to 3 and the number of homework drops from 8 to 12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will adjust the letter grade cutoffs if needed to reflect the unusual
challenges students have faced this semester.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will publish the letter grade cutoffs earlier in the semester so that
students can make informed decisions about whether to elect a Credit / No Credit
grade.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>This course is an introduction to the concepts and craft
<span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techne&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;external&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;techne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">1</span>
of computer science.
It will teach you to both <em>think</em> and <em>act</em> like a computer scientist.
It will change how you approach problems and provide you with powerful tools
that you <em>can</em> use to change the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer science is both an applied and a conceptual discipline.
You <em>will</em> learn how to program in this course.
Learning how to program effectively helps you bring your ideas to life.
It can be frustrating at first&#x2014;computers are irritatingly literal
machines.
But programming is a skill, and like any other skill you will get better with
practice.
Computers are one of the most powerful tools that we have at our disposal to
solve almost any problem.
Learning how to get them to do your bidding is extremely empowering.
You will quickly come to understand the hackers lament:
Once you can program well, you can do <strong>anything</strong>&#x2014;but you still can&#x2019;t do
<em>everything</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But while programming is both important and enjoyable, computer science also
has deep conceptual concerns at its core.
As a computer scientist, you&#x2019;ll learn to design solutions to problems so that
computers can carry them out efficiently&#x2014;we call these <strong>algorithms</strong>.
Being a computer scientist means coming up with new ways to solve problems
more effectively.
And then you get to build your solutions and can easily deploy them to
billions of people all over the world.
<strong>No other field has this potent mixture of left-brain analytics, right-brain
design and creativity, and the potential for global impact.</strong></p>

by Clive Thompson</a>
together, and there will be several quiz questions on the book each week.
<em>Coders</em> is both a fun read and an invaluable introduction to the technology
community.
It will help you better understand both how computer science has changed the
world, and how it may change you&#x2014;both for the better and for the not
better.

<div class="paragraph lead">
<p><strong>CS 125 assumes no prior knowledge of computer science or programming
experience.</strong>
However, the course is <em>a lot</em> of work&#x2014;and so is best suited to those who are
either majoring in computer science or have a strong interest in the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some students in CS 125 have no experience with computer science.
Others have been programming for years.
We will do our best to accommodate both groups.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_if_youre_new_to_computer_science"></a><h4>2.4.1. If you&#x2019;re new to computer science&#x2026;&#x200B;</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to the most exciting field on Earth!
We&#x2019;re extremely happy to have you.
We know that it can be hard to get started, but trust us&#x2014;you&#x2019;ll get
better with practice.
Programming is a skill.
The more you do, the better you get.
If you&#x2019;re willing to put in the time and energy, we&#x2019;re here to help you
succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#x2019;re starting something new, it&#x2019;s normal to occasionally feel
intimidated by those around you.
We were all new once, and most of us try new things at least once and a while.
So we know what it feels like.
Just remember that no matter how it may seem, there are a lot of other
students in CS 125 that are beginners too.
And if you&#x2019;re working harder than some other students in the class, then it
just means that you&#x2019;re learning more than they are.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also keep in mind that computer scientists can get extremely excited about
what they know.
Our field is awesome, and we&#x2019;re all learning new things all of the time.
Unfortunately, sometimes that can come off as arrogance or bragging.
But don&#x2019;t let it get you down.
We want you to share in the excitement, and will do our best to make sure that
happens.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#x2019;s so much more to learn!
No matter how much background in computer science you have, there are always
new areas to explore, new languages to learn, new problems to solve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even if you don&#x2019;t find every aspect of CS 125 challenging, we hope that it can
continue to move you forward on your journey in computer science.
Keep in mind that continuing to develop as a programmer requires practice.
If the MP checkpoints don&#x2019;t take you that long, then you aren&#x2019;t getting the
practice that you need to keep improving.
You might want to join the <a href="http://cs196.cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">honors section (CS
196)</a>,
get involved with the
<a href="https://acm.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">Illinois Chapter of the Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM)</a>,
or just make sure that you have some side projects to keep you busy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And please feel free to help other students in the class that might not know
as much as you.
One of the best things about computer science is the community of generous and
patient people willing to help beginners get started.</p>

<p>CS 125 is a large class.
This makes it important for us to communicate with each other in effective ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have set up a comprehensive and well-organized course website
<span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;You&amp;#x2019;re using it!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">7</span> and modern course <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a> to help you
find our what you need to know.
Our goal is to avoid email as much as possible, along with other 1-to-1 forms of
communication that don&#x2019;t scale well to large numbers of students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two primary sources of information for CS 125:</p>

<p>If you have a question about the class, first look on the main course

Then, search the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a>&#x2014;maybe another student has
asked your question and we&#x2019;ve already answered it.

<a class="anchor" id="_what_you_are_responsible_for"></a><h3>4.1. What You Are Responsible For</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student at the University of Illinois <strong>you are responsible for email sent
to your <code>@illinois.edu</code> email address.</strong>
We will occasionally use a course email list to send important announcements.
So messages in your inbox might say things like: &quot;There&#x2019;s a quiz tomorrow&quot; or
&quot;There&#x2019;s a fire alarm in Siebel and class is canceled.&quot;
We all get too much email, but learning to manage it is a fact of modern life.
Feel free to talk to the course staff if you want tips.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a student in CS 125 <strong>you are responsible for messages posted in the
<a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu/c/spring2020-announcements" class="noexternal">announcements
category of the forum</a>.</strong>
These announcements are important and we will frequently post in this category
in lieu of using email.
You can configure Discourse to send emails each time a topic is created in a
specific category.
We would suggest that you do that&#x2014;or plan on visiting the forum each and
every day.
In fact, both are good ideas.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="contacting"></a><h3>4.2. Contacting the Course Staff</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p><strong>Please do not email the course staff with general course questions.</strong>
You may think that the professor spending five minutes responding to your email
is not a huge problem.
But five-minute responses to 900 students consumes <em>75 hours</em> of time, which is
about half of my work week <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;OK, maybe a bit more than half.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">8</span>.
You should also never contact a TA or CA directly unless they have agreed to
this beforehand.
<em>Post on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not because we don&#x2019;t like you or don&#x2019;t like email.
It&#x2019;s simply because there are a lot of you, a much smaller number of us, and
many of the questions that you have are shared by other students.
If you email us, we can answer your question to one person: you.
If you post on the forum, we can answer your question to the entire class.
And you may find that your question has already been answered, or that another
student can answer it for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At times, I may even ask you to post on the forum if a good question or
observation comes out of a conversation that we have together.
That way everyone can learn what you just did, and I don&#x2019;t need to answer the
same question repeatedly.
If I ask you to do this, <em>please do</em>.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="_estimating_your_letter_grade"></a><h3>5.3. Estimating Your Letter Grade</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Letter grades in CS 125 are assigned based on how well <em>you</em> do, not based on
your performance relative to other students.
<strong>We have an unlimited number of A grades that we can hand out.</strong>
If everyone in the learns all of the material to our
satisfaction, everyone in the class will make an A.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inevitably the difficulty of various parts of the course varies from semester to
semester.
So we do not determine the final grading scale until we examine all scores at
the end of the semester.
During the semester, do not ask us to estimate your grade or tell you how well
you need to do on an assignment to make a certain grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Instead, focus on learning the material to the best of your ability.</strong>
Programming in particular is a skill&#x2014;the more you do, the better you get
at it.
So you should focus on doing as much as you need to get good at it, rather than
the minimum necessary to make a particular grade.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="mp"></a><h2>6. Machine Project (MP) <span class="text-muted">(30%)</span></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Programming is a skill.
Like other skills, the more you do it, the better at it you become.
The CS 125 <em>machine project</em> (MP)
is one of the primary ways that you will learn the powerful skill of computer
programming&#x2014;today&#x2019;s
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc&amp;t=81s" target="_blank" class="external">modern superpower</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The MP is worth 30% of your grade&#x2014;the largest single grade
component.
Working on it will deepen your understand of the material covered in lecture,
and improve your performance on the quizzes and midterms.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_not_machine_problems_a_machine_project"></a><h3>6.1. Not Machine <em>Problems</em>: A Machine <em>Project</em></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many other programming courses give a series of unconnected programming
assignments.
In prior semesters CS 125 did this as well and referred to each as a machine
<em>problem</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, last fall we replaced the multiple unconnected assignments with a
single <em>machine project</em>: an Android application that you will complete in parts
over the course of most of the semester.
Don&#x2019;t worry&#x2014;if you don&#x2019;t finish one part, we have ways to grade you future
work independently of that incomplete component.
But we do hope that this format will encourage you to fix up and improve the
parts of the project that you completed previously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Completing a single longer project will better prepare you for future
programming tasks&#x2014;both in industry and side projects that you may do on
your own.
It is rare in software development to start something from scratch, work on it
for only a few weeks, and then never touch it again.
What is more normal is to work on more interesting and larger pieces of code for
months or even years&#x2014;starting with something simple and then gradually
adding features and complexity, just as you will do this semester.
You are forced to live with your mistakes and decisions, but also end up
creating something much more significant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_split_deadlines"></a><h3>6.2. Split Deadlines</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To reduce load on office hours and provide you with better support around
checkpoint deadlines, this semester we will divide the class in half.
The Blue Group will have MP checkpoint deadlines on Sundays at 11:59PM.
The Orange Group will have MP checkpoint deadlines on Mondays at 11:59PM.
Your group assignment will be determined by your lab section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this means that, over the course of the semester, the Orange
Group has exactly 24 hours more to complete the entire machine project.
We consider the 50% reduction in peak office hour load to be sufficient to
justify this small difference.
Feel free to discuss this on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a> if it makes you uncomfortable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="_how_to_complete_the_mp"></a><h3>6.3. How to Complete the MP</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To help you conquer the large machine project, we will break it down into
checkpoints that will happen roughly once every two weeks once the project
begins.
Each checkpoint is designed to take a significant amount of time.
So you should arrange your schedule so that you can devote a significant amount
of time on them.
<strong>Do not start the night before.</strong>
Not only will it be unlikely that you will complete that component of the MP,
but you will also be unlikely to be able to get help when you get stuck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Learning to program is like learning other skills&#x2014;how to play an
instrument, throw a perfect spiral, cook the perfect omelete, or learn another
<em>human</em> language.
You have to do it <em>every day</em>.
You can&#x2019;t expect to complete a marathon or perform at Carnegie Hall if you start
practicing the night before.
So as soon as each checkpoint is released, sit down and spend a few hours on it.
And then do that the next day, and the day after that.
If you start early and work often, you will have no problem completing the
checkpoint before the deadline.
If it turns out to be easy for you, you&#x2019;ll be done early and can relax and help
other students.
If it turns out to be more difficult, you&#x2019;ll know early on and be able to budget
your time according to complete it on time.
<strong>Nothing correlates more strongly with success on the MP checkpoints than
starting early.</strong>
And coming to <a href="/info/resources/#hours">office hours</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="regrading"></a><h3>6.4. Late Submission Policy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is extremely important that you keep up with the MP.
CS 125 moves quickly, and if you get behind early you will quickly find yourself
lost and unable to complete the later assignments.
<strong>This is the number one reason students fail CS 125.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result, the late submission policy is designed to reward students that do a
fair amount of work <em>before</em> the deadline.
Here are the details of the policy:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can submit <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;by pushing&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">10</span> each MP checkpoint as many times as you
want until 11:59:59 PM on Wednesday 5/6/2020 (the last day of class).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late submissions can earn back 50% of any points lost by your best on-time
submission.
So if you submit code that earns 80/100 before the deadline, you will receive a
90/100 if you submit a perfect checkpoint after the deadline.
If you submit code that earns 0/100 before the checkpoint deadline, the best you
can do is a 50/100 with a perfect submission anytime after the deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late submissions will not recover any starting the checkpoint on time points.
So if there were 10 starting the checkpoint on time points that you did not
earn, and your best score before the deadline was a 60/100, the best you can do
is a 75/100: half of the 30 points you missed that were not for starting the
assignment on time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You will always receive the best score earned by any submission.</strong>
You can check your office MP checkpoint scores

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last few weeks of the course we will set you loose on a final project of
your choosing.
Our goal is that the machine project prepares you well to work on a final
project.
But the final project removes both the scaffolding of the machine project and
many of the rules.
You can build whatever you want, work in small teams, and are encouraged to
freely and appropriately use available open source libraries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will hold an (optional) final project fair on reading day for you to show off
your

<a class="anchor" id="homework"></a><h2>8. Homework <span class="text-muted">(20%)</span></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ensure that you get <em>daily</em> practice we will post daily small
programming homework problems for you to complete.
The reason we are doing this is simple: <strong>programming takes regular consistent
practice.</strong>
If you are training for a marathon, you have to run <em>almost every day</em>, not just
try to pack in hundreds of miles the week before the race.
Learning to program is similar.
In particular, when you are getting started you&#x2019;ll tired quickly from this
engaging right-left brain activity.
So it&#x2019;s better to do a bit each day than large amounts in one sitting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We expect that the daily homework problems should take you no more than
10&#x2013;15 minutes to complete, particularly if you have been coming to lecture
and keeping up with the MP.
Homework problems also a key way to prepare yourself for the programming component
of each week&#x2019;s quiz, since the programming problems on the quiz will look
similar to <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;and may even be identical to&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">11</span> the ones you&#x2019;ve been

Quizzes and midterms are given in the <a href="https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">University
of Illinois Computer-Based Testing Facility (CBTF)</a> and consist of questions
that are randomized and automatically graded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CBTF is one of the most powerful pedagogical tools that we have at our
disposal to help you learn to program, and we use it early and often.
All those other school that some of you wanted to get in to---Stanford,
Berkeley, MIT?
They are still giving programming exams <em>on paper</em> and grading them <em>by hand</em>
<span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;head explodes&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">12</span>!?!?!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here at Illinois we can evaluate your programming in a much more sane setting:
using a keyboard, and with automated computer-generated feedback to help you
identify and correct your mistakes.
Even though you may come to hate and fear the CBTF by the end of this semester,
it is a huge part of how we teach you to program in CS 125.
You are all lucky to be at the University of Illinois which had the foresight to
set up such a revolutionary facility.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>No course staff members are involved in grading CS 125 computerized exams, so

<a class="anchor" id="format"></a><h3>9.1. Format</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quiz questions are a mix of multiple-choice questions drawn from lecture and
small programming problems.
Many of the small programming questions that we use on the quizzes will reappear
on later homework assignments.
Or problems from the homework assignments may appear on quizzes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You only get one or two attempts at the multiple choice questions.
But you will have <em>unlimited</em> attempts at the programming problems without
losing credit.
At this stage, we <strong>want</strong> you to practice&#x2014;and we won&#x2019;t penalize you for
practicing.
However, obviously you do not have an unlimited amount of <em>time</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The multiple-choice questions should be easy if you have been coming to and
<a href="#participation">participating in lecture</a>.
<strong>You may find the programming questions more of a challenge.</strong>
Programming in the CBTF is quite different from machine project programming.
You don&#x2019;t have unlimited time or access to resources such as the course staff or
the internet.
However, we believe that there are small programming tasks that you should be
able to complete as the semester goes on <em>without</em> needing to look up things
online or ask for help.
That said, generally the programming challenges that appear on the quizzes will
be considerably easier than the MP checkpoint that you are working on at the
same point in the semester.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Quizzes focus on material covered that week, but all material covered that
semester is fair game.
<strong>The best way to prepare for a quiz is to <a href="#participation">participate in

Attend lectures and participate, attend labs and participate, work on the
assigned MP checkpoint (if any), and ask and answer questions on the <a href="https://cs125-forum.cs.illinois.edu" class="noexternal">forum</a>.
If you engage with the course content on a daily basis, you will not need to

<div class="paragraph">
<p>10% of your grade is earned by participating in lab section (5%) and lectures

We will use several tools to track your participation in scheduled course
activities.
However, here are the ground rules:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>You must participate in the lab or lecture that you are enrolled in.</strong>
CS 125 is always completely enrolled and so we have no space in other lab or
lecture sections.
If you attend the wrong lab or lecture, you will not receive participation
points.
Period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participation is not attendance.</strong>
Just having your butt in the right seat at the right time does not constitute
participation.
In labs, you are expected to be working with your section on the lab activity.
In lecture, you are expected to follow along and engage with the material.
If you attend, but do not participate, you will not earn points for
participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>You have several pre-excused absences.</strong>
You have <a href="#drops"><em>3 preexcused lab absences</em></a> and <a href="#drops"><em>6 preexcused
lecture absences</em></a>.
<strong>So if you need to miss a lab or lecture for any reason&#x2014;illness, traveling,
personal issues, or anything else&#x2014;there is no need to notify the course
staff.</strong>
If you miss a lab, feel free to attend
<a href="#labs">another lab section</a>, but you will not get lab participation points
for that week.
If you miss a lecture, just
<a href="/info/resources/#videos">watch the video online</a>
to review what you missed.
CS 125 moves fast, so don&#x2019;t get behind!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For both lecture and lab attendance you will receive a linear proportion of
credit depending on how many participation points you earn and the number of
dropped labs or lectures.
So, for example, if you miss 5 out of 10 labs, you would receive credit for 8 /
10 labs (due to three drops) and 4% out of the 5% allocated for lab
participation.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Attend lecture.</strong> (Duh.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Log on to the slide tool.</strong> If you don&#x2019;t see a green check box in the top
right, you are not logged in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow along with the slides.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The
<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/follow-along" target="_blank" class="external">definition of follow along</a>
is &quot;to move or proceed in accord or in unison with someone.&quot;
Following along with the slides means that when the presentation slide changes,
you change the one you are looking at as well.
Both the amount of time you have to notice that the slide has changed and the
overall percent of slides that you need to track are very generous.
If you are paying attention, you should not have a hard time earning
participation credit for each lecture.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="extracredit"></a><h2>11. Extra Credit</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There will be opportunities to earn extra credit this semester.
Note that we <em>do not</em> give extra credit for things that we think that you
absolutely should be doing to succeed in the class.
Extra credit is exactly that: <em>extra</em>.
We might provide extra credit for providing some data that helps improve the
class, or bearing with us while we try something experimental and new, or for
helping other students.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This semester we are planning at least the following extra credit opportunities:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>1%</strong> for completing our <a href="https://forms.gle/WDf8bniubhSeoKM77" target="_blank" class="external">initial student
survey</a>.
This data helps us improve the course for future semesters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>1%</strong> for participating in the final project fair, which will be held on
<strong>Thursday May 7th</strong> (Reading Day).
Participation is optional, but worth extra credit.</p>

<a class="anchor" id="other"></a><h2>12. Other Policies</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Below we summarize some other general course-related policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="cheating"></a><h3>12.1. Cheating</h3>
<div class="paragraph lead">
<p>Learning computer science requires hard work and practice.
If you submit code that is not your own work, or take other steps to subvert the
course policies, you are not getting the practice that you need to improve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>All work submitted for CS 125 must be your own.</strong>
Cheating in CS 125 may result in a grade reduction, your removal from the CS
program, or from the University of Illinois.
We have many bright, honest students that want to learn computer science.
We don&#x2019;t need to waste time and energy on cheaters that don&#x2019;t want to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Specifically, the following activities constitute cheating and will be dealt
with according to relevant
<a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code" target="_blank" class="external">departmental</a>
and <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">university policies</a>.
<strong>You may not</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><strong>Turn in work that was completed by anyone other than yourself.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy or paste code that you did not write</strong> from any source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misrepresent your work as the work of another student.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine another classmates solution</strong>, reproduce it, and submit it as your own
work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Share information about the content of quizzes or other course assessments.</strong>
Anyone caught removing information from the exam center will receive a letter
grade reduction and a FAIR violation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Publish your MP or coursework anywhere where other students can find them.</strong>
Note that this includes publishing your MP publicly on GitHub.
Nobody wants to see your solutions to the MP anyway.
If you want to impress employers, fill your GitHub page with your own
independent projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We <em>will</em> run cheating detection software on all submitted student work.
These programs are extremely accurate, and any evidence of cheating that they
uncover will initiate academic integrity violation proceedings.
<strong>In Fall 2019 we filed 26 FAIR violations almost all of which resulted a
letter grade reduction.</strong>
We are serious about this, and ask you to be serious about learning.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<a class="anchor" id="_a_simple_rule_of_thumb_about_collaboration"></a><h4>12.1.1. A simple rule of thumb about collaboration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A general rule of thumb is that exchanging or soliciting <em>ideas</em> about how to
solve the MP is not cheating, but exchanging code is cheating.
Feel free to discuss your solutions with other students as long as you do not
provide them or allow them to view your source code.
If you are talking in English <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;or another spoken human language&amp;#x2026;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">13</span>,
that&#x2019;s fine.
If you are talking or exchanging <em>computer code</em>, that&#x2019;s cheating.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<a class="anchor" id="_penalties"></a><h4>12.1.2. Penalties</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>If you are caught cheating in CS 125 you will <em>definitely</em> receive a FAIR
violation.</strong>
Depending on the severity of the situation, you may also have any of the
following penalties applied:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A letter grade reduction in the class.
<strong>Note that this will likely make it impossible for you to transfer into the
Computer Science department.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An F in the course.
<strong>This will <em>definitely</em> make it impossible for you to transfer into the major.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="extensions"></a><h3>12.2. Extensions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CS 125 is a fast-moving and demanding course.
You signed up to learn computer science and programming for 15 weeks, and we do
our best to give you your money&#x2019;s worth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the consequences of this is that it is hard to catch up if you have a
significant illness or other problem mid-semester.
We will give extensions on the MP and other assignments to accommodate
unforeseen short-term circumstances.
But if you are struggling with a larger issue, we may encourage you to withdraw
and enroll again next semester.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note that, to receive an extension you should approach the course staff <em>before</em>
the relevant deadline.</strong>
Except in exceptional cases <span class="badge badge-illinois-orange" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="top" data-html="true" data-content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;such as hospitalization, verifiable kidnapping by aliens, etc.&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;">14</span> we will <em>not</em> grant requests for extensions or other
accommodations after the relevant deadline has passed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<a class="anchor" id="accommodations"></a><h3>12.3. Accommodations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are more than happy to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
learning disabilities or other challenges.
<strong>However, we ask that you assist us by informing us of your situation as soon
as possible.</strong>
We will be much more accommodating of requests received <em>before</em> the relevant
assessment or deadlines, rather than after.
The earlier in the semester you can let us know what kind of help you need, the
better prepared we can be to provide it effectively.
<strong>Please use <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/fIpBGh7fl19KQmRN2" target="_blank" class="external">this web form</a> to ensure that
we have your Letter of Accommodation on file.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that in many cases your letter of accommodation will <em>require</em> that you
request accommodations before or on the relevant deadlines.
If you fail to do so, we will not consider late requests.
Part of our job in ensuring that you&#x2014;and every CS 125
student&#x2014;succeeds in the course is keeping you on track throughout the
semester.
By the time the end of the semester rolls around, it is far to late to begin
asking for deadline extension and completing missed assignments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As far as our
<a href="#quizzes">quizzes in the CBTF</a>,
if you have accommodations identified by the
<a href="https://disability.illinois.edu/" target="_blank" class="external">Division of Rehabilitation-Education
Services (DRES)</a>
for quizzes and midterms, please take your Letter of Accommodation to the CBTF
proctors in person before you make your first reservation.
The proctors will advise you as to whether the CBTF provides your accommodations
or whether you will need to make other arrangements.</p>
